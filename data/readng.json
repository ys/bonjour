Our spirits lift as our mind quietens; our soul is restored by the natural beauty and endurance of the landscape. As we adjust to the rhythm of walking, the earth offers up support and reassurance. In Path, a beautifully written parable from the unique and soulful voice of Louisa Thomsen Brits, a solitary figure walks through uncertainty and isolation to reach an understanding that they are not alone, but part of the world around them.

En retraçant son passé, elle découvre à quel point l’alcool a été le pilier de sa construction et de son personnage de femme. Sans alcool est le journal de son sevrage.

Alors qu’on lui a toujours vendu la sobriété comme le choix des cons et des culs bénis, elle réalise qu’on l’a sans doute flouée.

It’s a story of extremes—extreme sports and extreme emotions. <br /><br />On the wild, lonely coast of Western Australia, two thrillseeking and barely adolescent boys fall into the enigmatic thrall of veteran big-wave surfer Sando. Together they form an odd but elite trio. The grown man initiates the boys into a kind of Spartan ethos, a regimen of risk and challenge, where they test themselves in storm swells on remote and shark-infested reefs, pushing each other to the edges of endurance, courage, and sanity. But where is all this heading? Why is their mentor’s past such forbidden territory? And what can explain his American wife’s peculiar behavior? Venturing beyond all limits—in relationships, in physical challenge, and in sexual behavior—there is a point where oblivion is the only outcome. Full of Winton’s lyrical genius for conveying physical sensation, Breath is a rich and atmospheric coming-of-age tale from one of world literature’s finest storytellers.","pageCount":218,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317792624l/2176735._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":2361,"name":"Tim Winton","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":3.9,"max_score":5,"count":18214,"updated":"2021-05-26T19:27:10.719964Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1317792624l/2176735._SY475_.jpg","slug":"breath-by-tim-winton-rXT46","workId":null,"addedAt":"2021-01-06"},{"id":"eIsXl","title":"Chroniques du royaume journal de bord d’une étrange année","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2020-11-25","isbn10":"9782957550","isbn13":null,"description":"À travers ce journal de bord tenu quotidiennement de mars à octobre 2020, Elisa Routa pose son regard sur une année marquée par de grands bouleversements et fait le constat d’un monde qui glisse.

In this beautifully written exploration of the power of light, Matt Gaw ventures forth into darkness to find out exactly what we're missing: walking by the light of the moon in Suffolk and under the scattered buckshot of starlight in Scotland; braving the darkest depths of Dartmoor; investigating the glare of 24/7 London and the suburban sprawl of Bury St Edmunds; and, finally, rediscovering a sense of the sublime on the Isle of Coll.<br /><br /><b><i>Under the Stars</i> is an inspirational and immersive call to reconnect with the natural world, showing how we only need to step outside to find that, in darkness, the world lights up.<br /><br />________________________<br /><br />'Enchanting, fascinating and written with real soul and sensitivity.'</b> - Rob Cowen, author of <i>Common Ground</i><br /><br /><b>'One of the most inspiring of our young nature writers, with a highly original journey into darkness and night'</b> - Stephen Moss, naturalist and author of <i>The Robin: A Biography</i><br /><br /><b>'Lyrical, warm, and suffused with the magic of the night'</b> - Patrick Barkham, author of <i>The Butterfly Isles</i><br /><br /><b>'A beautiful and - no other word is more apt - luminous love letter to the night sky.'</b> - Julian Hoffman, author of <i>Irreplaceable</i><br /><br /><b>'Passionately argued and perfectly crafted... <i>Under the Stars</i> is a timely and inspiring manifesto explaining how \"by lighting our world sparingly, carefully...we can achieve something that would improve human health, protect wildlife, and help us to reconnect to the landscape and starscape at night\".' </b> - <i>The Countryman</i>","pageCount":208,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576230601l/49217481._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":50662,"name":"Matt Gaw","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png"}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.2,"max_score":5,"count":112,"updated":"2021-02-12T12:33:44.388787Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576230601l/49217481._SY475_.jpg","slug":"under-the-stars-by-matt-gaw-NWvb5","workId":null,"addedAt":"2020-12-19"},{"id":"DmMJU","title":"Le surf change le monde","subtitle":"","publishedDate":null,"isbn10":null,"isbn13":"9782956913702","description":"","pageCount":null,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":""},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":231453,"name":"Gibus de Soultrait","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.0,"max_score":5,"count":2,"updated":"2021-02-12T12:33:44.446397Z"}],"thumbnail":"","slug":"le-surf-change-le-monde-by-gibus-de-soultrait-DmMJU","workId":null,"addedAt":"2020-12-13"},{"id":"QOnVT","title":"Do What You Want: The Story of Bad Religion","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2020-08-18","isbn10":"0306922223","isbn13":"9780306922220","description":"<b>From their beginnings as teenagers experimenting in a San Fernando Valley garage dubbed \"The Hell Hole\" to headlining major music festivals around the world, <i>Do What You Want</i>tells the whole story of Bad Religion's 40-year career in irreverent style. </b><br /><br /><i>Do What You Want: The Story of Bad Religion</i> reveals the ups and downs of the band's forty-year career.

Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood—where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned—Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.<br /><br />In Whitehead’s ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor—engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city’s placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.<br /><br />Like the protagonist of Gulliver’s Travels, Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey—hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre–Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman’s ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.","pageCount":306,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493178362l/30555488._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9780385542364"}],"authors":[{"id":11421,"name":"Colson Whitehead","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.0,"max_score":5,"count":183,"updated":"2021-06-08T12:16:11.055546Z"},{"source":"recs","score":6.0,"max_score":null,"count":6,"updated":"2021-06-08T12:15:57.805219Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":5.0,"max_score":5,"count":1,"updated":"2021-06-03T07:51:51.220251Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1493178362l/30555488._SY475_.jpg","slug":"the-underground-railroad-by-colson-whitehead-ccI0V","workId":"1557","addedAt":"2020-10-25"},{"id":"zQhiK","title":"La République du bonheur","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2020-08-20","isbn10":"2809714967","isbn13":"9782809714968","description":"La vie est douce à Kamakura.

She empowers readers to think about their stuff and the environment in a new way, helping them make more informed choices when it comes to the future of our world.<br /><br /> Most importantly, this is a book about the power we have as voters and consumers to make sure that the fight against climate change includes all of us and all of our stuff, not just industry groups and politicians.

Rachel Carson's rare ability to combine scientific insight with moving, poetic prose catapulted her book to first place on <em>The New York Times</em> best-seller list, where it enjoyed wide attention for thirty-one consecutive weeks. It remained on the list for more than a year and a half and ultimately sold well over a million copies, has been translated into 28 languages, inspired an Academy Award-winning documentary, and won both the 1952 National Book Award and the John Burroughs Medal.<br /><br />This classic work remains as fresh today as when it first appeared. Carson's writing teems with stunning, memorable images--the newly formed Earth cooling beneath an endlessly overcast sky; the centuries of nonstop rain that created the oceans; giant squids battling sperm whales hundreds of fathoms below the surface; and incredibly powerful tides moving 100 billion tons of water daily in the Bay of Fundy. Quite simply, she captures the mystery and allure of the ocean with a compelling blend of imagination and expertise.<br /><br />Reintroducing a classic work to a whole new generation of readers, this Special Edition features a new chapter written by Jeffrey Levinton, a leading expert in marine ecology, that brings the scientific side of <em>The Sea Around Us</em> completely up to date. Levinton incorporates the most recent thinking on continental drift, coral reefs, the spread of the ocean floor, the deterioration of the oceans, mass extinction of sea life, and many other topics. In addition, acclaimed nature writer Ann Zwinger has contributed a brief foreword.<br /><br />Today, with the oceans endangered by the dumping of medical waste and ecological disasters such as the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, this illuminating volume provides a timely reminder of both the fragility and the importance of the ocean and the life that abounds within it.

Dans l'Italie de la Renaissance, Bianca, demoiselle de bonne famille, est en âge de se marier. Ses parents lui trouvent un fiancé à leur goût : Giovanni, un riche marchand, jeune et plaisant. Le mariage semble devoir se dérouler sous les meilleurs auspices même si Bianca ne peut cacher sa déception de devoir épouser un homme dont elle ignore tout. Mais c'était sans connaître le secret détenu et légué par les femmes de sa famille depuis des générations : une « peau d'homme » ! En la revêtant, Bianca devient Lorenzo et bénéficie de tous les attributs d'un jeune homme à la beauté stupéfiante. Elle peut désormais visiter incognito le monde des hommes et apprendre à connaître son fiancé dans son milieu naturel. Mais dans sa peau d'homme, Bianca s'affranchit des limites imposées aux femmes et découvre l'amour et la sexualité. La morale de la Renaissance agit alors en miroir de celle de notre siècle et pose plusieurs questions : pourquoi les femmes devraient-elles avoir une sexualité différente de celle des hommes ? Pourquoi leur plaisir et leur liberté devraient-ils faire l'objet de mépris et de coercition ? Comment enfin la morale peut-elle être l'instrument d'une domination à la fois sévère et inconsciente ? À travers une fable enlevée et subtile comme une comédie de Billy Wilder, Hubert et Zanzim questionnent avec brio notre rapport au genre et à la sexualité... mais pas que.

Her story is raw like that first bite of wild onion, alive with startling imagery, and told with uncommon emotional power.<br /><br />Regan grew up the youngest of four headstrong girls on a small farm in Northwest Indiana. While gathering raspberries as a toddler, Regan preternaturally understood to pick just the ripe fruit and leave the rest for another day. In the family's leaf-strewn fields, the orange flutes of chanterelles beckoned her while they eluded others.<br /><br />Regan has had this intense, almost otherworldly connection with food and the earth it comes from since her childhood, but connecting with people has always been more difficult. She was a little girl who longed to be a boy, gay in an intolerant community, an alcoholic before she turned twenty, and a woman in an industry dominated by men--she often felt she \"wasn't made for this world,\" and as far as she could tell, the world tended to agree. But as she learned to cook in her childhood farmhouse, got her first restaurant job at age fifteen, taught herself cutting-edge cuisine while running a \"new gatherer\" underground supper club, and worked her way from front-of-house staff to running her own kitchen, Regan found that food could help her navigate the strangeness of the world around her.<br /><br />Regan cooks with instinct, memory, and an emotional connection to her ingredients that can't be taught. Written from that same place of instinct and emotion, <i>Burn the Place</i> tells Regan's story in raw and vivid prose and brings readers into a world--from the Indiana woods to elite Chicago kitchens--that is entirely original and unforgettable.","pageCount":250,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557712148l/40916358._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":33353,"name":"Iliana Regan","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png"}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":3.6,"max_score":5,"count":1708,"updated":"2020-12-30T05:00:37.728727Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557712148l/40916358._SY475_.jpg","slug":"burn-the-place-by-iliana-regan-Foxez","workId":null,"addedAt":"2020-04-21"},{"id":"h1tqF","title":"J'aurais pu devenir millionnaire, j'ai choisi d'être vagabond","subtitle":"","publishedDate":null,"isbn10":"2375020898","isbn13":"9782375020890","description":"Inventeur génial dès son plus jeune âge, amoureux de la nature, grand marcheur, il sillonna le monde à pied et fut le premier à percevoir les dangers de l'exploitation de la nature.

She moved from New York to San Francisco, where she landed at a big-data startup in the heart of the Silicon Valley bubble: a world of surreal extravagance, dubious success, and fresh-faced entrepreneurs hell-bent on domination, glory, and, of course, <i>progress</i>.<br /><br />Anna arrived amidst a massive cultural shift, as the tech industry rapidly transformed into a locus of wealth and power rivaling Wall Street.

Marie Kondo and other decluttering gurus promise that shedding our stuff will solve our problems. We commit to cleanse diets and strive for inbox zero. Amid the frantic pace and distraction of everyday life, we covet silence-and airy, Instagrammable spaces in which to enjoy it. The popular term for this brand of upscale austerity, “minimalism,” has mostly come to stand for things to buy and consume. But minimalism has richer, deeper, and altogether more valuable gifts to offer.<br /><br />Kyle Chayka is one of our sharpest cultural observers. After spending years covering minimalist trends for leading publications, he now delves beneath this lifestyle's glossy surface, seeking better ways to claim the time and space we crave. He shows that our longing for less goes back further than we realize. His search leads him to the philosophical and spiritual origins of minimalism, and to the stories of artists such as Agnes Martin and Donald Judd; composers such as John Cage and Julius Eastman; architects and designers; visionaries and misfits. As Chayka looks anew at their extraordinary lives and explores the places where they worked-from Manhattan lofts to the Texas high desert and the back alleys of Kyoto-he reminds us that what we most require is presence, not absence. The result is an elegant new synthesis of our minimalist desires and our profound emotional needs.","pageCount":272,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1573880988l/44453047._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9781635572100"}],"authors":[{"id":24910,"name":"Kyle Chayka","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":3.6,"max_score":5,"count":629,"updated":"2021-06-02T02:08:32.997126Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1573880988l/44453047._SY475_.jpg","slug":"the-longing-for-less-by-kyle-chayka-PIGAC","workId":"1408","addedAt":"2020-02-02"},{"id":"cLOiR","title":"Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2019-02-05","isbn10":"0525536515","isbn13":"9780525536512","description":"<b>The key to living well in a high tech world is to spend much less time using technology.</b><br /><br />Georgetown computer scientist Cal Newport's Deep Work sparked a movement around the idea that unbroken concentration produces far more value than the electronic busyness that defines the modern work day. But his readers had an urgent follow-up question: What about technology in our personal lives?<br /><br />In recent years, our culture's relationship with personal technology has transformed from something exciting into something darker. Innovations like smartphones and social media are useful, but many of us are increasingly troubled by how much control these tools seem to exert over our daily experiences--including how we spend our free time and how we feel about ourselves.<br /><br />In Digital Minimalism, Newport proposes a bold solution: a minimalist approach to technology use in which you radically reduce the time you spend online, focusing on a small set of carefully-selected activities while happily ignoring the rest.<br /><br />He mounts a vigorous defense for this less-is-more approach, combining historical examples with case studies of modern digital minimalists to argue that this philosophy isn't a rejection of technology, but instead a necessary realignment to ensure that these tools serve us, not the other way around.<br /><br />To make these principles practical, he takes us inside the growing subculture of digital minimalists who have built rich lives on a foundation of intentional technology use, and details a decluttering process that thousands have already used to simplify their online lives. He also stresses the importance of never clicking \"like,\" explores the underappreciated value of analog hobbies, and draws lessons from the \"attention underground\"--a resistance movement fighting the tech companies' attempts to turn us into gadget addicts.<br /><br />Digital Minimalism is an indispensable guide for anyone looking to reclaim their life from the alluring diversions of the digital world.","pageCount":304,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544192948l/40405444._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9780525536512"}],"authors":[{"id":321,"name":"Cal Newport","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"recs","score":9.0,"max_score":null,"count":12,"updated":"2021-06-10T01:02:37.585373Z"},{"source":"gdreads","score":4.1,"max_score":5,"count":44202,"updated":"2021-06-09T02:14:30.958716Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":4.1,"max_score":5,"count":43544,"updated":"2021-05-23T15:39:44.845650Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544192948l/40405444._SY475_.jpg","slug":"digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport-cLOiR","workId":"674","addedAt":"2019-12-15"},{"id":"4kbcx","title":"In Waves","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2019-06-04","isbn10":"1910620300","isbn13":"9781910620304","description":"In this graphic novel, surfer and illustrator AJ Dungo remembers his late partner and the shared love of surfing that endured throughout their time together.<br /><br />Dungo explores the beauty and complexity of his relationship with his partner as they face her prolonged battle with cancer.

In his new book, <i>Stillness Is the Key</i>, Holiday draws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those charging ahead.</b><br /><br />All great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes, and visionaries share one indelible quality. It enables them to conquer their tempers. To avoid distraction and discover great insights. To achieve happiness and do the right thing. Ryan Holiday calls it stillness--to be steady while the world spins around you.<br /><br />In this book, he outlines a path for achieving this ancient, but urgently necessary way of living. Drawing on a wide range of history's greatest thinkers, from Confucius to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius to Thich Nhat Hanh, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, he argues that stillness is not mere inactivity, but the doorway to self-mastery, discipline, and focus.<br /><br />Holiday also examines figures who exemplified the power of stillness: baseball player Sadaharu Oh, whose study of Zen made him the greatest home run hitter of all time; Winston Churchill, who in balancing his busy public life with time spent laying bricks and painting at his Chartwell estate managed to save the world from annihilation in the process; Fred Rogers, who taught generations of children to see what was invisible to the eye; Anne Frank, whose journaling and love of nature guided her through unimaginable adversity.<br /><br />More than ever, people are overwhelmed. They face obstacles and egos and competition. <i>Stillness Is the Key </i>offers a simple but inspiring antidote to the stress of 24/7 news and social media. The stillness that we all seek is the path to meaning, contentment, and excellence in a world that needs more of it than ever.","pageCount":288,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566883842l/43582733._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":998,"name":"Ryan Holiday","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.2,"max_score":5,"count":2,"updated":"2021-06-09T12:48:15.297628Z"},{"source":"recs","score":2.0,"max_score":null,"count":3,"updated":"2021-06-09T12:47:59.168448Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566883842l/43582733._SY475_.jpg","slug":"stillness-is-the-key-by-ryan-holiday-LWc17","workId":"741","addedAt":"2019-12-08"},{"id":"xp9Tw","title":"Un Fou Ordinaire","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2009-01-08","isbn10":"2351780213","isbn13":"9782351780213","description":"\" Au-delà du mur de la ville irréelle, au-delà des enceintes de sécurité coiffées de fil de fer barbelé et de tessons de bouteille, au-delà des périphériques d'asphalte à huit voies, au-delà des berges bétonnées de nos rivières temporairement barrées et mutilées, au-delà de la peste des mensonges qui empoisonnent l'atmosphère, il est un autre monde qui vous attend.

Ces animaux discrets et très craintifs vivent sur un gigantesque plateau culminant à 5 000 m d'altitude, le Changtang. Situé au Tibet septentrional et occidental, il s'étend sur environ 1 600 km, du Ladakh à la province du Qinghai, et il est habité par les nomades Changpas.<br />L'équipe atterrit à Pékin, puis prend la route à bord d'un 4X4 en direction du Tibet. Au fil des jours le convoi s'achemine vers des panoramas de plus en plus grandioses et déserts : là où la population recule, la faune avance et se déploie, protégée des effets nocifs de la civilisation.<br />Sylvain Tesson décrit une sorte de savane africaine qui serait perchée à 4 000 mètres d'altitude, où l'on croise des troupeaux d'antilopes, des chèvres bleues, des hordes de yacks qui traversent de vastes étendues herbeuses où s'élèvent des dunes.<br />L'équipe s'enfonce toujours plus loin, se hissant à des hauteurs qui dépassent largement ce que nous connaissons en Europe. À 5 000 m d'altitude s'ouvre le domaine de la panthère des neiges. Dans ce sanctuaire naturel totalement inhospitalier pour l'homme, le félin a trouvé les moyens de sa survie et de sa tranquillité. Les conditions d'observation deviennent très difficiles, il faut parfois rester immobile pendant trente heures consécutives par -30° C pour apercevoir quelques minutes le passage majestueux de l'animal...<br />Sylvain Tesson entrecroise habilement le récit d'une aventure exceptionnelle aux confins du Tibet avec des réflexions d'une pertinence remarquable sur les conséquences désastreuses de l'activité humaine envers le règne animal. À travers l'exemple de la panthère des neiges, l'auteur s'interroge sur la morphologie d'un monde où toutes les espèces viendraient à se raréfier puis à s'éteindre.

Through a series of personal journeys, Dan Richards explores their romantic and exploratory appeal. Wildernesses, seemingly untouched by man's hand: mountains, tundra, forests, oceans and deserts. These are landscapes that speak of deep time, whose scale can knock us down to size. Their wildness is part of their beauty and such places have long drawn the adventurous, the spiritual, the artistic.<br /><br />For those who go in search of the isolation, silence and adventure of wild places it is - perhaps ironically - to the man-made shelters that they need to head; the outposts: bothies, bivouacs, cabins and huts. Part of their allure is their simplicity: enough architecture to shelter from the weather but not so much as to distract from the immediate environment around.<br /><br />Following a route from the Cairngorms of Scotland to the fire-watching huts of Washington State, from Iceland's Houses of Joy to the desert of New Mexico, and from the frozen beauty of Svalbard to a lighthouse perched in the Atlantic, Richards uncovers landscapes which have inspired writers, artists and musicians, and asks: why are we drawn to wilderness?

He had never been overseas; had hardly even left the quiet village he grew up in. His idea was to walk through the country, earning money for food by playing his violin in bars and plazas.<br /><br />Nearly a century later, the book Laurie Lee wrote – <em>As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning</em> – inspired Alastair Humphreys.

He travelled slow, lived simply, slept on hilltops, relished spontaneity, and loved conversations with the different people he met along the hot and dusty road.<br /><br />For 15 years, Alastair dreamed of retracing Laurie Lee’s footsteps, but could never get past the hurdle of being distinctly unmusical. This year, he decided to go anyway. The journey was his most terrifying yet, risking failure and humiliation every day, and finding himself truly vulnerable to the rhythms of the road and of his own life.

Commence La retraite de Russie, l'une des plus tragique épopée de l'Histoire humaine. La Retraite est une course à La mort, une marche des fous, une échappée d'enfer. Deux cents ans plus tard, je décide de répéter l'itinéraire de l'armée agonisante, de ces cavaliers désarçonnés, de ces fantassins squelettiques, de ces hommes à plumets qui avaient préjugé de l'invincibilité de l'Aigle. Il ne s'agit pas d'une commémoration (commémore-t-on l'horreur ?), encore moins d'une célébration, il s'agit de saluer par-delà les siècles et les verstes, ces Français de l'an XII aveuglés par le soleil corse et fracassés sur les récifs du cauchemar. Le géographe Cédric Gras, le photographe Thomas Goisque et deux amis russes, Vassili et Vitaly, sont de la partie. Pour l'aventure, nous enfourchons des side-cars soviétiques de marque Oural. Ces motocyclettes redéfinissent en permanence les lois élémentaires de la mécanique. Rien ne saurait les arrêter (pas même leurs freins). Notre escouade se compose de trois Oural, chargées ras la gueule de pièces détachées et de livres d'Histoire. Au long de quatre mille kilomètres, en plein hiver, nous allons dérouler le fil de la mémoire entre Moscou et Paris où l'Empereur arrivera le 15 XII 1812, laissant derrière lui son armée en lambeaux. Le jour, les mains luisantes de cambouis, nous lisons les Mémoires du général de Caulaincourt. Le soir, nous nous assommons de vodka pour éloigner les fantômes. A l'aube, nous remettons les gaz vers une nouvelle étape du chemin de croix. Smolensk, Minsk, Berezina, Vilnius : les stèles de la souffrance défilent à cinquante à l'heure. Partout, nous rencontrons des Russes qui ne tiennent aucune rigueur à l'Empereur à bicorne. Sous nos casques crénelés de stalactites, nous prenons la mesure des tourments des soldats et nous menons grand train ce débat intérieur : Napoléon était-il un antéchrist qui précipita l'Europe dans l'abîme ou bien un visionnaire génial dont le seul tort fut de croire qu'il suffisait de vouloir pour triompher, et que les contingences se pliaient toujours aux rêves ? Mais très vite, nous devons abandonner ces questions métaphysiques car un cylindre vient de rendre l'âme, la nuit tombe sur la Biélorussie et trois foutus camions polonais sont déjà en travers de la route.","pageCount":199,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422193844l/24683905._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":31075,"name":"Sylvain Tesson","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":3.9,"max_score":5,"count":662,"updated":"2020-11-26T21:16:49.036648Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422193844l/24683905._SY475_.jpg","slug":"berezina-by-sylvain-tesson-Cdvgp","workId":null,"addedAt":"2019-03-27"},{"id":"25Lst","title":"L'Arabe du futur 4 : Une jeunesse au Moyen-Orient, 1987-1992","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2018-09-27","isbn10":"2370731257","isbn13":"9782370731258","description":"Âgé de neuf ans au début de ce volume, le petit Riad devient adolescent.

Dans ces chroniques, Paul Ariès nous invite à suivre les réflexions des objecteurs de croissance. Égratignant à la fois les donneurs de leçons, les spéculateurs environnementaux et les vendeurs de développement durable, il appelle surtout à la «croissance » de l'imaginaire et des liens sociaux, afin de s'offrir collectivement une vie qui ne soit pas plus opulente, mais plus libre, plus signifiante et, finalement, plus humaine. Il n'hésite pas à s'interroger sur les dérives possibles de la décroissance, qu'il aime décrire comme « un chemin de crête », dont pourraient découler le pire et le meilleur. Combien de fois n'ai-je pas entendu des activistes de la décroissance regretter le bon temps où l'on pouvait consommer sans se priver? Même si une croissance infinie était matériellement possible, nous la refuserions pour rester des humains. Notre combat n'est donc nullement fondé en dernière analyse sur l'imminence de l'épuisement des ressources, mais sur la certitude que l'ensemble des crises qui affectent l'humanité ont une seule et unique cause : la perte du sens des limites. L'auteur, politologue et militant Paul Ariès, bien connu pour sespositions contre les sectes et la malbouffe, est l'un des principaux défenseurs dela décroissance équitable.

Leaping at this chance to be a mountain man, with no experience in the wilds, he left the world. Thirteen years later, he published his beloved memoir of that winter, Indian Creek Chronicles —Into the Wild with a twist.<br /><br />Twenty five years later, he was asked to return to the wilderness to babysit more fish eggs. But no longer a footloose twenty year old, at forty-five, he was the father of two young sons. He left again, alone, straight into the heart of Montana’s Bob Marshall wilderness, walking a daily ten mile loop to his fish eggs through deer and elk and the highest density of grizzly bears in the lower 48 states. <br /><br />The Names of the Stars is not only a story of wilderness and bears but also a trek through a life lived at its edges, showing how an impulsive kid transformed into a father without losing his love for the wilds. From loon calls echoing across Northwood lakes to the grim realities of life guarding in the Nevada desert, through the isolation of Indian Creek and years spent running the Snake and Rio Grande as a river ranger, Pete seeks out the source of this passion for wildness, as well as explores fatherhood and mortality and all the costs and risks and rewards of life lived on its own terms.","pageCount":272,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1454880100l/28220883._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":76853,"name":"Pete Fromm","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.1,"max_score":5,"count":370,"updated":"2020-12-13T19:58:04.800738Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1454880100l/28220883._SY475_.jpg","slug":"the-names-of-the-stars-by-pete-fromm-z7X3X","workId":null,"addedAt":"2018-06-06"},{"id":"yhj44","title":"Read This If You Want to Take Great Photographs","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2014-03-25","isbn10":"1780673353","isbn13":"9781780673356","description":"Photography is now more popular than ever thanks to the rapid development of digital cameras. <em>Read This If You Want to Take Great Photographs</em> is for this new wave of DSLR dabblers and users of compact system, and bridge cameras.

De février à juillet 2010, il a choisi de faire l’expérience du silence, de la solitude, et du froid. Sa cabane, construite par des géologues soviétiques dans les années brejnéviennes, est un cube de rondins de trois mètres sur trois, chauffé par un poêle en fonte, à six jours de marche du premier village et à des centaines de kilomètres d’une piste. Vivre isolé du monde nécessite avant tout de s’imposer un rythme. Le matin, Sylvain Tesson lit, écrit, fume, ou dessine. Puis ce sont cinq longues heures consacrées à la vie domestique : il faut couper le bois, déblayer la neige, préparer les lignes de pêche, réparer les avanies de l’hiver… Le défi de six mois d’ermitage, c’est de savoir si l’on réussira à se supporter. En cas de dégoût de soi, nulle épaule où s’appuyer, nul visage pour se lustrer les yeux. L’inspecteur forestier<br />Chabourov qui l’a déposé sur cette grève le premier jour le savait. Il lui a glissé, énigmatique, en se touchant la tempe : « Ici, c’est un magnifique endroit pour se suicider ». La solitude finira par se révéler fertile : quand on n’a personne à qui exposer ses pensées, la feuille de papier est un confident précieux ; le carnet de note, un compagnon poli. C’est ce journal que nous offre à lire Sylvain Tesson. En notant minutieusement, presque quotidiennement, ses impressions face au silence, ses luttes pour survivre dans une nature hostile, ses désespoirs, ses doutes, mais aussi, ses moments d’extase, de paix intérieure et d’osmose avec la nature, Sylvain Tesson nous fait partager une expérience hors du commun. Finalement « la vie en cabane apprend à peupler l’instant, à ne rien attendre de l’avenir et à accepter ce qui advient comme une fête. Le génie du lieu aide à apprivoiser le temps ». Une expérience comme seule la littérature peut la ressaisir afin qu’elle ne soit pas seulement une aventure isolée, mais une aventure exceptionnelle à la portée de tous.","pageCount":271,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525975248l/12503306._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":31075,"name":"Sylvain Tesson","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gbooks","score":4.0,"max_score":5,"count":5,"updated":"2021-05-23T02:52:14.647867Z"},{"source":"gdreads","score":3.9,"max_score":5,"count":4284,"updated":"2021-05-23T02:15:35.291461Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525975248l/12503306._SY475_.jpg","slug":"dans-les-forêts-de-sibérie-by-sylvain-tesson-UPKmp","workId":"21648","addedAt":"2018-05-21"},{"id":"uoZGT","title":"The Monkey Wrench Gang (Monkey Wrench Gang, #1)","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2006-12-12","isbn10":"0061129763","isbn13":"9780061129766","description":"Ed Abbey called <i>The Monkey Wrench Gang</i>, his 1975 novel, a \"comic extravaganza.\" Some readers have remarked that the book is more a comic book than a real novel, and it's true that reading this incendiary call to protect the American wilderness requires more than a little of the old willing suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The story centers on Vietnam veteran George Washington Hayduke III, who returns to the desert to find his beloved canyons and rivers threatened by industrial development. On a rafting trip down the Colorado River, Hayduke joins forces with feminist saboteur Bonnie Abbzug, wilderness guide Seldom Seen Smith, and billboard torcher Doc Sarvis, M.D., and together they wander off to wage war on the big yellow machines, on dam builders and road builders and strip miners. As they do, his characters voice Abbey's concerns about wilderness preservation (\"Hell of a place to lose a cow,\" Smith thinks to himself while roaming through the canyonlands of southern Utah. \"Hell of a place to lose your heart. Hell of a place... to lose. Period\").<br /><br />Moving from one improbable situation to the next, packing more adventure into the space of a few weeks than most real people do in a lifetime, the motley gang puts fear into the hearts of their enemies, laughing all the while.

He washes up in Butcher’s Crossing, a small Kansas town on the outskirts of nowhere. Butcher’s Crossing is full of restless men looking for ways to make money and ways to waste it. Before long Andrews strikes up a friendship with one of them, a man who regales Andrews with tales of immense herds of buffalo, ready for the taking, hidden away in a beautiful valley deep in the Colorado Rockies. He convinces Andrews to join in an expedition to track the animals down. The journey out is grueling, but at the end is a place of paradisal richness. Once there, however, the three men abandon themselves to an orgy of slaughter, so caught up in killing buffalo that they lose all sense of time. Winter soon overtakes them: they are snowed in.

A fictionalised account of his own journeys across America with his friend Neal Cassady, Kerouac’s beatnik odyssey captured the soul of a generation and changed the landscape of American fiction for ever.<br /><br />Influenced by Jack London and Thomas Wolfe, Kerouac always wanted to be a writer, but his true voice only emerged when he wrote about his own experiences in On the Road. Leaving a broken marriage behind him, Sal Paradise (Kerouac) joins Dean Moriarty (Cassady), a tearaway and former reform school boy, on a series of journeys that takes them from New York to San Francisco, then south to Mexico. Hitching rides and boarding buses, they enter a world of hobos and drifters, fruit-pickers and migrant families, small towns and wide horizons. Adrift from conventional society, they experience America in the raw: a place where living is hard, but ‘life is holy and every moment is precious’.<br /><br />With its smoky, jazz-filled atmosphere and its restless, yearning spirit of adventure, On the Road left its mark on the culture of the late 20th century, influencing countless books, films and songs. Kerouac’s prose is remarkable both for its colloquial swing and for the pure lyricism inspired by the American landscape – ‘the backroads, the black-tar roads that curve among the mournful rivers like Susquehanna, Monongahela, old Potomac and Monocacy’. This Folio Society edition is illustrated with evocative photographs of Kerouac and the landscapes of 1950s America. Now acknowledged as a modern classic, On the Road remains a thrilling and poignant story of the road less travelled.","pageCount":307,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1413588576l/70401._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9780140042597"}],"authors":[{"id":356,"name":"Jack Kerouac","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":3.6,"max_score":5,"count":364135,"updated":"2021-06-02T17:06:24.402607Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":3.0,"max_score":5,"count":3060,"updated":"2021-05-04T17:04:51.790160Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1413588576l/70401._SY475_.jpg","slug":"on-the-road-by-jack-kerouac-TkUn7","workId":"104","addedAt":"2018-03-11"},{"id":"a9pAo","title":"Le garçon sauvage","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2017-08-17","isbn10":"2264070080","isbn13":"9782264070081","description":"Le garçon sauvage commence sur un hiver particulier : Paolo Cognetti, 30 ans, étouffe dans sa vie milanaise et ne parvient plus à écrire.

Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else entirely: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. <i>Barbarian Days</i> takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses—off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships annealed in challenging waves.<br /><br />Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites-only gang in a tough school in Honolulu even while his closest friend was a Hawaiian surfer. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly—he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui—is served up with rueful humor. He and a buddy, their knapsacks crammed with reef charts, bushwhack through Polynesia. They discover, while camping on an uninhabited island in Fiji, one of the world’s greatest waves. As Finnegan’s travels take him ever farther afield, he becomes an improbable anthropologist: unpicking the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissecting the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, navigating the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity.<br /><br /><i>Barbarian Days </i>is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little understood art. Today, Finnegan’s surfing life is undiminished. Frantically juggling work and family, he chases his enchantment through Long Island ice storms and obscure corners of Madagascar.","pageCount":447,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1418768620l/18693910._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":18315,"name":"William Finnegan","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png"}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.2,"max_score":5,"count":20955,"updated":"2021-06-06T11:21:10.332529Z"},{"source":"recs","score":1.0,"max_score":null,"count":1,"updated":"2021-04-08T06:05:48.333037Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":4.0,"max_score":5,"count":13,"updated":"2021-01-01T02:12:04.444788Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1418768620l/18693910._SY475_.jpg","slug":"barbarian-days-by-william-finnegan-3mxeM","workId":"10010","addedAt":"2018-01-09"},{"id":"5lYRX","title":"Sex Criminals: Volume Four: Fourgy","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2017-10-03","isbn10":"153430231X","isbn13":"9781534302310","description":"Everybody's favorite sex-having, time-freezing, bank-robbing crew of lovable love-misfits come together and ask themselves the big question: are we still into this?

In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back.<br /><br /><i>The Ego is the Enemy</i> draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to history. We meet fascinating figures like Howard Hughes, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, all of whom reached the highest levels of power and success by conquering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well.<br /><br />But why should we bother fighting ego in an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion?  Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, “you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you’ve set out to achieve.”","pageCount":226,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459114043l/27036528._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9781591847816"}],"authors":[{"id":998,"name":"Ryan Holiday","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.1,"max_score":5,"count":42714,"updated":"2021-06-12T05:25:45.241041Z"},{"source":"recs","score":4.0,"max_score":null,"count":7,"updated":"2021-05-03T23:59:47.156417Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":4.0,"max_score":5,"count":174,"updated":"2021-01-21T00:00:22.890509Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459114043l/27036528._SY475_.jpg","slug":"ego-is-the-enemy-by-ryan-holiday-rxedV","workId":"663","addedAt":"2018-01-02"},{"id":"XqFQm","title":"Indian Creek Chronicles: A Winter Alone in the Wilderness","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2003-10-17","isbn10":"0312422725","isbn13":"9780312422721","description":"Winner of the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Book Award,<i> Indian Creek Chronicles</i> is Pete Fromm's account of seven winter months spent alone in a tent in Idaho guarding salmon eggs and coming face to face with the blunt realities of life as a contemporary mountain man.

A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure, involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.<br /><br />We all have a voice in our head. It’s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we’re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we’re stuck with this voice – that there’s nothing we can do to rein it in – but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It’s a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead, it’s something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness.<br /><br /><em>10% Happier</em> takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America’s spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.","pageCount":256,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451446393l/18505796._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":1852,"name":"Dan   Harris","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":3.9,"max_score":5,"count":89202,"updated":"2021-06-02T02:10:09.049627Z"},{"source":"recs","score":1.0,"max_score":null,"count":1,"updated":"2021-05-05T19:03:47.760170Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":4.0,"max_score":5,"count":3305,"updated":"2020-11-26T20:04:20.589526Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451446393l/18505796._SY475_.jpg","slug":"10-happier-by-dan-harris-DDpg2","workId":"233","addedAt":"2016-09-30"},{"id":"natpL","title":"ChatOps: Managing Operations in Group Chat","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2016-08-12","isbn10":"1491962305","isbn13":"9781491962305","description":"ChatOps is about using group chat tools to go beyond basic conversation, juxtaposing discussion with context and actions taken from within the chat tool itself.

I'm going to share that mindset with you — along with hundreds of actionable techniques and proven habits — so you can shortcut those years.<br /><br />Introducing The Effective Engineer — the only book designed specifically for today's software engineers, based on extensive interviews with engineering leaders at top tech companies, and packed with hundreds of techniques to accelerate your career.<br /><br />For two years, I embarked on a quest seeking an answer to one question:<br /><br />How do the most effective engineers make their efforts, their teams, and their careers more successful?<br /><br />I interviewed and collected stories from engineering VPs, directors, managers, and other leaders at today's top software companies: established, household names like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn; rapidly growing mid-sized companies like Dropbox, Square, Box, Airbnb, and Etsy; and startups like Reddit, Stripe, Instagram, and Lyft.<br /><br />These leaders shared stories about the most valuable insights they've learned and the most common and costly mistakes that they've seen engineers — sometimes themselves — make.<br /><br />This is just a small sampling of the hard questions I posed to them:<br /><br />- What engineering qualities correlate with future success?<br />- What have you done that has paid off the highest returns?<br />- What separates the most effective engineers you've worked with from everyone else?<br />- What's the most valuable lesson your team has learned in the past year?<br />- What advice do you give to new engineers on your team? <br /><br />Everyone's story is different, but many of the lessons share common themes.<br /><br />You'll get to hear stories like:<br /><br />- How did Instagram's team of 5 engineers build and support a service that grew to over 40 million users by the time the company was acquired?<br />- How and why did Quora deploy code to production 40 to 50 times per day?<br />- How did the team behind Google Docs become the fastest acquisition to rewrite its software to run on Google's infrastructure?<br />- How does Etsy use continuous experimentation to design features that are guaranteed to increase revenue at launch?<br />- How did Facebook's small infrastructure team effectively operate thousands of database servers?<br />- How did Dropbox go from barely hiring any new engineers to nearly tripling its team size year-over-year? <br /><br />What's more, I've distilled their stories into actionable habits and lessons that you can follow step-by-step to make your career and your team more successful.<br /><br />The skills used by effective engineers are all learnable.<br /><br />And I'll teach them to you. With The Effective Engineer, I'll teach you a unifying framework called leverage — the value produced per unit of time invested — that you can use to identify the activities that produce disproportionate results.<br /><br />Here's a sneak peek at some of the lessons you'll learn. You'll learn how to:<br /><br />- Prioritize the right projects and tasks to increase your impact.<br />- Earn more leeway from your peers and managers on your projects.<br />- Spend less time maintaining and fixing software and more time building and shipping new features.<br />- Produce more accurate software estimates.<br />- Validate your ideas cheaply to reduce wasted work.<br />- Navigate organizational and people-related bottlenecks.<br />- Find the appropriate level of code reviews, testing, abstraction, and technical debt to balance speed and quality.<br />- Shorten your debugging workflow to increase your iteration speed.","pageCount":260,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427583285l/25238425._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9780996128100"}],"authors":[{"id":30300,"name":"Edmond Lau","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.3,"max_score":5,"count":1273,"updated":"2021-05-26T19:24:25.845722Z"},{"source":"recs","score":1.0,"max_score":null,"count":1,"updated":"2021-03-13T13:55:44.857658Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427583285l/25238425._SY475_.jpg","slug":"the-effective-engineer-by-edmond-lau-2rhrR","workId":"17723","addedAt":"2016-09-30"},{"id":"cGiNn","title":"Southern Bastards, Vol. 2: Gridiron","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2015-05-06","isbn10":"163215269X","isbn13":"9781632152695","description":"The hit new crime series SOUTHERN BASTARDS returns for its second volume, as JASON AARON (Scalped, Thor, Star Wars) and JASON LATOUR (Spider-Gwen, Loose Ends) pull back the curtain on the dark and seedy history of Craw County and its most famous and feared resident, the high school football coach turned backwoods crime lord Euless Boss.<br /><br />Collects SOUTHERN BASTARDS #5-8.","pageCount":128,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448892158l/23911614._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":32492,"name":"Jason Aaron","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.2,"max_score":5,"count":4200,"updated":"2021-05-05T20:32:16.118725Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448892158l/23911614._SY475_.jpg","slug":"southern-bastards-vol-2-by-jason-aaron-cGiNn","workId":null,"addedAt":"2016-08-06"},{"id":"iF8Hr","title":"Lazarus, Vol. 2: Lift","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2014-06-24","isbn10":"1607068710","isbn13":"9781607068716","description":"While Forever keeps watch on her sister Johanna, she finds hints of rebellion brewing in LA. <br /><br />At the same time, the Barrets, a family of \"Waste,\" lose their home and land, and must pursue their only chance for a better life - a 500-mile journey to Denver in the hope that one of their family will be noticed by the Carlyles and \"lifted\" to Serf status. <br /><br />Collecting LAZARUS #5-9","pageCount":null,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1406821536l/20299674._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":39090,"name":"Greg Rucka","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.1,"max_score":5,"count":4635,"updated":"2021-04-15T11:06:17.745774Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1406821536l/20299674._SY475_.jpg","slug":"lazarus-vol-2-by-greg-rucka-iF8Hr","workId":null,"addedAt":"2016-08-06"},{"id":"EJyeM","title":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child: Parts One and Two (Harry Potter, #8)","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2016-07-31","isbn10":"0751565350","isbn13":"9780751565355","description":"Based on an original new story by J.K.

There has never been a more important time to rediscover your pause button. Calm is the book that will show you how to take back a little bit of peace, space and all-important calm. This book contains the simple tools, tricks and habits that will change the rest your life. It is a practical and pleasurable guide to twenty-first century mindfulness. Regular meditation is medically proven to be good for you - it increases focus and creativity, productivity and job satisfaction, mental and even physical health. But in reality most of us don't have time to sit on a cushion with our eyes closed for half an hour every day. And many people associate meditation with hard work and huge lifestyle shifts- you might be imagining Buddhist monks locked in a mountain retreat and living off gruel... This is where Calm comes in. Calm is about simple, achievable habits that work with the demands of your busy life instead of pretending those demands don't exist. Calm does not require specialist training- it uses abilities that every single one of us is born with, like creativity, spontaneity and simply noticing the world around you. Calm is not a set of rules that you need to worry about following or breaking. It is inspirational, practical and non-prescriptive. Onerous, time-consuming meditation might seem out of reach but everyone can achieve calm - including you.","pageCount":224,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427663630l/25194140._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":76863,"name":"Michael Acton Smith","image_url":"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png"}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.2,"max_score":5,"count":1432,"updated":"2021-04-29T12:29:48.259686Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427663630l/25194140._SY475_.jpg","slug":"calm-by-michael-acton-smith-tiG1C","workId":null,"addedAt":"2016-02-18"},{"id":"BXi3d","title":"Everything That Remains: A Memoir by the Minimalists","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2013-12-23","isbn10":"1938793188","isbn13":"9781938793189","description":"\"Like Henry David Thoreau, but with Wi-Fi.\" — Boston Globe <br /><br />What if everything you ever wanted isn't what you actually want? Twenty-something, suit-clad, and upwardly mobile, Joshua Fields Millburn thought he had everything anyone could ever want. Until he didn't anymore. Blindsided by the loss of his mother and his marriage in the same month, Millburn started questioning every aspect of the life he had built for himself. Then, he accidentally discovered a lifestyle known as minimalism...and everything started to change. <br /><br />That was four years ago. Since, Millburn, now 32, has embraced simplicity.

So, when everything was gone, what was left? <br /><br />Not a how-to book but a why-to book, Everything That Remains is the touching, surprising story of what happened when one young man decided to let go of everything and begin living more deliberately.

With this work, Adrian Tomine (Shortcomings, Scenes from an Impending Marriage) reaffirms his place not only as one of the most significant creators of contemporary comics but as one of the great voices of modern American literature. His gift for capturing emotion and intellect resonates here: the weight of love and its absence, the pride and disappointment of family, the anxiety and hopefulness of being alive in the twenty-first century.<br /><br />“Amber Sweet” shows the disastrous impact of mistaken identity in a hyper-connected world; “A Brief History of the Art Form Known as Hortisculpture” details the invention and destruction of a vital new art form in short comic strips; “Translated, from the Japanese” is a lush, full-color display of storytelling through still images; the title story, “Killing and Dying”, centers on parenthood, mortality, and stand-up comedy. In six interconnected, darkly funny stories, Tomine forms a quietly moving portrait of contemporary life.<br /><br />Tomine is a master of the small gesture, equally deft at signaling emotion via a subtle change of expression or writ large across landscapes illustrated in full color. Killing and Dying is a fraught, realist masterpiece.","pageCount":121,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421836999l/23848562._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":26575,"name":"Adrian Tomine","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.0,"max_score":5,"count":8465,"updated":"2021-06-02T02:10:25.004339Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421836999l/23848562._SY475_.jpg","slug":"killing-and-dying-by-adrian-tomine-B7Cew","workId":"1138","addedAt":"2015-12-31"},{"id":"3Rv44","title":"Crucial Conversations Skills","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2011-11-18","isbn10":"0071796266","isbn13":"9780071796262","description":"How Do You Communicate When the Stakes Are High?<br /><br />Learn how with these TWO GROUNDBREAKING BOOKS in ONE eBOOK PACKAGE!<br /><br />In any organization, the best laid plans boil down to one simple thing: how well we come together to bring them to fruition.

But what happens when you want to pair with someone in another city, country, or even hemisphere? With the right tools, you won't have to relocate to refactor. In this book, you'll learn techniques used by the most productive remote programmers in the industry to pair with anyone on the globe on any kind of project. You'll use collaborative editors, screen sharing, secure networking, and virtualization to create a remote pairing environment that feels as if your partner is sitting right next to you.<br /><br /> Two heads are better than one, but only if they're working on the same problem. When pairing remotely, this requires a specialized environment that you'll learn how to create. We'll use the same open-source tools as the pros to improve collaboration and increase productivity. You'll learn techniques, patterns, and best practices you can apply to projects of all kinds. These tools are so effective that many co-located programmers use them despite sitting side-by-side--you don't have to work outside of an office for this book to improve your programming techniques.<br /><br /> We'll start by creating a secure collaborative editing environment capable of handling the low-bandwidth networks at some coffee shops. Then we'll share your screen using free open source tools and protocols. We'll deploy all of this to a server in the cloud so you can access your development environment from anywhere. Then we'll use one of the most advanced integrated development environments to collaborate, sketch on a virtual whiteboard, and resolve conflicts.<br /><br /> Finally, we'll talk with programmers at Pivotal Labs, Big Nerd Ranch, and other top-notch distributed development firms to learn how they handle the challenges of remote pairing on a daily basis. With their help and advice, you can be productive from any location on the planet.<br /><br /><b>What You Need:</b> Many of the examples in this book require an internet connection. You'll only need one computer for most of the exercises, and you can run them by yourself.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.<br /><br />Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.<br /><br />Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \"By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?\"<br /><br />Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.","pageCount":342,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312647l/8908._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9780307346605"}],"authors":[{"id":353,"name":"Max Brooks","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.0,"max_score":5,"count":465116,"updated":"2021-06-11T22:38:57.539605Z"},{"source":"recs","score":2.0,"max_score":null,"count":4,"updated":"2021-05-14T01:08:54.796528Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":4.0,"max_score":5,"count":448468,"updated":"2020-12-30T18:56:06.892326Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312647l/8908._SY475_.jpg","slug":"world-war-z-by-max-brooks-fQ70i","workId":"100","addedAt":"2009-12-26"},{"id":"aitZq","title":"Ordinary Victories","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2005-05-01","isbn10":"1561634239","isbn13":"9781561634231","description":"This is the story of Marc, a photographer who’s tired, of a very patient chick he meets, of banal horrors and of his pain-in-the-neck cat.

He describes the ongoing management of individual attentiveness and the impairment of perception within the compulsory routines of contemporary technological culture. At the same time, he shows that human sleep, as a restorative withdrawal that is intrinsically incompatible with 24/7 capitalism, points to other more formidable and collective refusals of world-destroying patterns of growth and accumulation.","pageCount":144,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1373997570l/16284965._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[],"authors":[{"id":56810,"name":"Jonathan Crary","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":3.8,"max_score":5,"count":1779,"updated":"2021-05-30T16:28:56.185641Z"},{"source":"recs","score":0.0,"max_score":null,"count":1,"updated":"2021-03-05T03:31:02.470082Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1373997570l/16284965._SY475_.jpg","slug":"247-by-jonathan-crary-zlIbZ","workId":"10210","addedAt":"2020-10-15"},{"id":"oo4GX","title":"The Ecology of Imagination in Childhood","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"1998-05-15","isbn10":"0882143603","isbn13":"9780882143606","description":"Is genius shaped by the imagination of childhood?

Having a lot of stuff, when she decluttered and got rid of 80-85% of it. Having a home, when she decided to fully embrace her nomadic lifestyle. In Adventures in Opting Out, Flanders offers a trail map to following her example and building a slow, mindful, minimalist life that emphasizes the beauty of the natural world, the importance of real human connection, the joys of travel, and the happiness that comes from living an intentional life in harmony with your own values. Choosing to opt out is a brave decision, and ultimately an infinitely rewarding one. But that doesn't mean it's easy. There will be hardships along the way -- relationships damaged, demons faced, addictions confronted -- but with Flanders's guidance and advice, drawn from her own journey and examples of others who have picked the road less traveled, you'll have all he encouragement and insight you'll need to build a life of purpose, fulfillment and adventure.","pageCount":272,"language":"en","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1579612843l/50358141._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9780316536943"},{"store":"bkshp-uk","url":"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/3364/9780316536943"}],"authors":[{"id":26425,"name":"Cait Flanders","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":3.5,"max_score":5,"count":52,"updated":"2020-12-30T08:53:45.457283Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":3.5,"max_score":5,"count":342,"updated":"2020-12-14T01:33:04.609883Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1579612843l/50358141._SY475_.jpg","slug":"adventures-in-opting-out-by-cait-flanders-bHqHI","workId":"2986","addedAt":"2020-09-11"},{"id":"C5323","title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2017-04-13","isbn10":"1473221633","isbn13":"9781473221635","description":"'A rich and complex story of friendship and love' GUARDIAN 'It's a giant thought experiment that's also a cracking good read about gender' Neil Gaiman 'Love doesn't just sit there, like a stone, it has to be made, like bread; remade all the time, made new' Two people, until recently strangers, find themselves on a long, tortuous and dangerous journey across the ice.

She’s given a five percent chance of survival and one percent chance of walking again. One month later after a spinal fusion surgery, Ruthie defies the odds, leaving the hospital on her own two feet.<br /><br />Just a few years later, newly married and living in Nashville, Ruthie begins to experience debilitating pain. Her case confounds doctors and after numerous rounds of testing, imaging, and treatment, they prescribe narcotic painkillers—lots of them.

Effective altruism is built upon the simple but profound idea that living a fully ethical life involves doing the \"most good you can do.\" Such a life requires an unsentimental view of charitable giving: to be a worthy recipient of our support, an organization must be able to demonstrate that it will do more good with our money or our time than other options open to us.

Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible. Through eye-opening, entertaining stories filled with the adrenaline of launch, the mesmerizing wonder of spacewalks, and the measured, calm responses mandated by crises, he explains how conventional wisdom can get in the way of achievement-and happiness. His own extraordinary education in space has taught him some counterintuitive lessons: don't visualize success, do care what others think, and always sweat the small stuff. <br /><br />You might never be able to build a robot, pilot a spacecraft, make a music video or perform basic surgery in zero gravity like Col. Hadfield. But his vivid and refreshing insights will teach you how to <i>think</i> like an astronaut, and will change, completely, the way you view life on Earth-especially your own.","pageCount":295,"language":"","imageLinks":{"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380495144l/18170143._SY475_.jpg"},"purchaseLinks":[{"store":"bookshop","url":"https://bookshop.org/a/13153/9780316253017"}],"authors":[{"id":11718,"name":"Chris Hadfield","image_url":""}],"ratings":[{"source":"gdreads","score":4.1,"max_score":5,"count":52194,"updated":"2021-05-30T20:41:49.059612Z"},{"source":"recs","score":0.0,"max_score":null,"count":1,"updated":"2021-05-17T21:13:29.515270Z"},{"source":"gbooks","score":4.1,"max_score":5,"count":51674,"updated":"2021-05-08T10:37:04.056184Z"}],"thumbnail":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380495144l/18170143._SY475_.jpg","slug":"an-astronauts-guide-to-life-on-earth-by-chris-hadfield-8xQhv","workId":"2247","addedAt":"2017-08-07"},{"id":"yH1wQ","title":"The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers","subtitle":"","publishedDate":"2014-03-04","isbn10":"0062273205","isbn13":"9780062273208","description":"A lot of people talk about how great it is to start a business, but only Ben Horowitz is brutally honest about how hard it is to run one.<br /><br />In <em>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</em>, Ben Horowitz, cofounder of Andreessen Horowitz and one of Silicon Valley's most respected and experienced entrepreneurs, draws on his own story of founding, running, selling, buying, managing, and investing in technology companies to offer essential advice and practical wisdom for navigating the toughest problems business schools don't cover.
