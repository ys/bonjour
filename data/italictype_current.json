Today, professional skateboarders land endorsement deals with Nike and Adidas, while popular television series like HBO’s Betty tell the stories of diverse crews of skaters living in New York City. So how did a fledgling subculture rise from its near-death knell in the ’90s to become ubiquitous today? It was simply a matter of finding the right messenger.</p><p><br></p><p>In 1999, the bestselling video game Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was released, and a new generation was exposed to skateboarding culture right in their very own homes. Kids and adults alike could now spend hours playing as actual skateboarders, learning the vernacular, listening to the music skateboarders loved, and having fun onscreen before trying to skate IRL in the driveway.</p><p><br></p><p>Right, Down + Circle explores how a video game starring the most famous pro skater in the world brought skateboarding culture — and its ever-shifting markers of music, subversion, and coolness — to the masses and ultimately transformed the culture it borrowed from in the process.</p>","isbn_10":"1778521975","isbn_13":"9781778521973","asin":"","page_count":124,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=k2XDEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE70LXX_ltxfWyW6ce1kcip71sf9DIJh-UlYRGulyKE7lGuanckERGfjVP2JrkJ2HkDO_9G45uzM26MKHjOne3lNxC6BuVUReL_GEDJ0DP_1n3BFhlc_xzcuMudh4l-svTtHoyjWP&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2023-10-19T08:10:11.125468Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T08:10:11.488695Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/IkQjcIOG18/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/k2XDEAAAQBAJ/right-down-circle"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":1,"display_state_queue_name":"Currently reading","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2023-10-19T08:10:15.081771Z","finished_reading_at":null,"restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2023-10-19T08:10:11.136031Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T08:10:15.120370Z","user_review":null,"page_count":124,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"8WZYllv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/8WZYllv/","book":{"id":"5gaYlB8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/5gaYlB8/","share_identifier":"6OqrBLaQEb","slug":"saving-time","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"3-RzEAAAQBAJ","source_etag":"DvqThI0pjv8","title":"Saving Time","subtitle":"Discovering a Life Beyond the Clock","authors":["Jenny Odell"],"publisher":"Random House Publishing Group","published_date":"2023-03-07","description":"<b>A radical argument that we are living on the wrong clock--one that tells us time is money—and that there are other ways of experiencing time that offer bold, hopeful possibilities for ourselves and the planet from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of<i> How to Do Nothing</i>.</b><br><br>Our daily experience, dominated by the corporate clock that so many of us contort ourselves to fit inside, is destroying us. It wasn’t built for people, it was built for profit. This is a book that tears open the seams of reality as we know it—the way we experience time itself—and rearranges it, reimagining a world not centered around work, the office clock, or the profit motive. Explaining how we got to the point where time became money, Odell offers us new models to live by--inspired by pre-industrial cultures, ecological, and geological time--that make a more humane, more hopeful way of living seem possible.<br><br>In this dazzling, subversive, and deeply hopeful reframing of time, Jenny Odell takes us on a journey through other temporal habitats. As planet-bound animals, we live inside shortening and lengthening days, alongside gardens growing, birds migrating, and cliffs eroding. The stretchy quality of waiting and desire, the way the present may suddenly feel marbled with childhood memory, the slow but sure procession of a pregnancy, or the time it takes to heal from injuries--physical or emotional. Odell urges us to become stewards of these different rhythms of life, to imagine a life, identity, and source of meaning outside of the world of work and profit, and to understand that the trajectory of our lives--or the life of the planet--is not a foregone conclusion. In that sense, “saving” time—recovering its fundamentally irreducible and inventive nature—could also mean that time saves us.","isbn_10":"0593242718","isbn_13":"9780593242711","asin":"","page_count":400,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3-RzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE70WVkHvaT95pJxVMVyJuiOlrYLOFRXdX6R8IR3-GYVHdoOfGVgAQWxmicDKHepE4KHzMCLskrnk72zl9jtMTNAsIBgcs4KJSBsHDoWikz8JAdBAWhGu8afvLFOWB25hxa6Rr23d&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2022-09-25T20:02:43.740813Z","updated_at":"2022-09-25T20:02:44.121619Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/6OqrBLaQEb/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/3-RzEAAAQBAJ/saving-time"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":1,"display_state_queue_name":"Currently reading","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2023-08-22T20:35:50.016893Z","finished_reading_at":null,"restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2023-08-22T20:35:41.937783Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T20:35:50.050082Z","user_review":null,"page_count":400,"percent_complete":0}]}
