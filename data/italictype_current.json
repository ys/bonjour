Partiellement amnésique, il se souvient être à la recherche de deux autres agents mystérieusement disparus dans la région. Il se rend vite compte qu’il n’a plus de papiers, ni de téléphone et, en dépit de ses efforts, il ne parvient à joindre ni sa femme, ni son supérieur, ni personne du monde extérieur.
