While mindfulness is considered the heart of Buddhist meditation, its essence is universal and of deep practical benefit, potentially to all. <br><br>In essence, mindfulness is about embodied wakefulness. Our minds are such that we are often more asleep than awake to the unique beauty and possibilities of each present moment. While it is in the nature of all our minds to default to autopilot and lose touch with the only time we actually have to live - to feel, to grow, to love, to learn, to give shape to things, to heal - our mind also holds the innate capacity to awaken to each moment. <br><br>This book gives you a variety of ways to experiment with not missing your moments and take maximal advantage of them by tending what most needs tending to now. Given the myriad mega-challenges humanity and planet Earth are facing at this time, Wherever You Go, There You Are can provide both a personal refuge for meaning - making, healing and transformation, as well as a locus for collaborating with others to heal the suffering of the world.</p>","isbn_10":"0349414238","isbn_13":"9780349414232","asin":"","page_count":193,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=kVHhCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE70CBc7yOoIu6dO4M5NaeJtdupEhxqQ9N6-nrLBAYb_Nn__GL6sEjBEXALp6b1UHc-G5B8YKhLVipxqn71_MVDF6PI6B5wBCZ8IIfOEdF7kJ8YKS7MWyDTCjtOXOvEVnN_XaLAdS&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2024-02-17T07:36:06.993133Z","updated_at":"2024-02-17T07:36:07.294114Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/NEOKKNwVlv/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/kVHhCwAAQBAJ/wherever-you-go-there-you-are-5"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":1,"display_state_queue_name":"Currently reading","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2024-02-17T07:36:21.236315Z","finished_reading_at":null,"restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2024-02-17T07:36:07.002546Z","updated_at":"2024-02-17T07:36:21.242430Z","user_review":null,"page_count":193,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"vZ2GMkv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/vZ2GMkv/","book":{"id":"8MJgEmN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/8MJgEmN/","share_identifier":"aLIHEcj6mO","slug":"harlem-shuffle-5","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"zJKdEAAAQBAJ","source_etag":"DMMzGKdlk6s","title":"Harlem shuffle","subtitle":"","authors":["Colson Whitehead"],"publisher":"ALBIN MICHEL","published_date":"2023-01-04","description":"<p>\" Sublime roman [...] Harlem Shuffle est un page turner comme Colson Whitehead sait si bien en faire.\" Livres Hebdo</p><p>Petites arnaques, embrouilles et lutte des classes...

It wasn’t built for people, it was built for profit. This is a book that tears open the seams of reality as we know it—the way we experience time itself—and rearranges it, reimagining a world not centered around work, the office clock, or the profit motive. Explaining how we got to the point where time became money, Odell offers us new models to live by--inspired by pre-industrial cultures, ecological, and geological time--that make a more humane, more hopeful way of living seem possible.<br><br>In this dazzling, subversive, and deeply hopeful reframing of time, Jenny Odell takes us on a journey through other temporal habitats. As planet-bound animals, we live inside shortening and lengthening days, alongside gardens growing, birds migrating, and cliffs eroding. The stretchy quality of waiting and desire, the way the present may suddenly feel marbled with childhood memory, the slow but sure procession of a pregnancy, or the time it takes to heal from injuries--physical or emotional. Odell urges us to become stewards of these different rhythms of life, to imagine a life, identity, and source of meaning outside of the world of work and profit, and to understand that the trajectory of our lives--or the life of the planet--is not a foregone conclusion. In that sense, “saving” time—recovering its fundamentally irreducible and inventive nature—could also mean that time saves us.","isbn_10":"0593242718","isbn_13":"9780593242711","asin":"","page_count":400,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=3-RzEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE70WVkHvaT95pJxVMVyJuiOlrYLOFRXdX6R8IR3-GYVHdoOfGVgAQWxmicDKHepE4KHzMCLskrnk72zl9jtMTNAsIBgcs4KJSBsHDoWikz8JAdBAWhGu8afvLFOWB25hxa6Rr23d&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2022-09-25T20:02:43.740813Z","updated_at":"2022-09-25T20:02:44.121619Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/6OqrBLaQEb/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/3-RzEAAAQBAJ/saving-time"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":1,"display_state_queue_name":"Currently reading","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2023-08-22T20:35:50.016893Z","finished_reading_at":null,"restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2023-08-22T20:35:41.937783Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T20:35:50.050082Z","user_review":null,"page_count":400,"percent_complete":0}]}
