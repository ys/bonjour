De la découverte des îles du Pacifique par le capitaine Cook à l'annexion de l'archipel par les Etats-Unis, les obstacles à son ascension furent nombreux et souvent dramatiques : guerres fratricides, épidémies mortelles et missionnaires brutaux ont bien failli faire sombrer l'art de la glisse dans l'oubli, en même temps que la culture hawaïenne. Jérémy Lemarié retrace de manière inédite cette aventure extraordinaire, qui commence avec l'arrivée des premiers Polynésiens sur l'archipel et la naissance des premiers royaumes. Vous découvrirez que notre amour pour l'océan, le culte du corps, les rituels de baignade et l'art de chevaucher les déferlantes sont autant d'héritages issus de la culture insulaire. De Mark Twain à Jack London en passant par le Capitaine Cook et Duke Kahanamoku, jusqu'aux plages de Biarritz : une philosophie est née, avec ses légendes, ses héros, ses révolutions, et surtout, sa recherche éperdue de liberté.

C’est pendant, et à la suite de ce séjour, qu’elle écrit ce récit. Là, sous le grand phare du Créac’h, se racontent un voyage immobile et une expérience d’immersion au contact des éléments et des îliens. Elle explore les lieux et rencontre les habitants, les derniers marins de commerce, les guetteurs-sémaphoriques et gardiens de phares, et les femmes, gardiennes des lieux, qui occupent une place prépondérante sur cette île du Ponant. On découvre cet espace à part, territoire de l’extrême entretenant un rapport particulier à la noirceur et à la mort. Face à la mer et sous les faisceaux du grand phare, l’auteure vit cette expérience comme une renaissance dans le passage et l’exil que représente l’écriture. Gwenaëlle Abolivier est journaliste et auteure. Elle est une voix de France Inter. Elle présente pendant plus de vingt ans des émissions de grands reportages où elle raconte ses voyages à travers le monde.

À la naissance de sa fille Mollie, il s’est rangé des planches. À ses douze ans, lorsqu’elle se révèle une grimpeuse-née, l’écrivain-reporter décide de la suivre dans son apprentissage. Tandis que Mollie endosse le rôle d’entraîneur et de mentor, voire de gourou, son père se doit de repousser sans cesse ses limites pour suivre son rythme, bousculant quelque peu la dynamique parent-enfant. Il raconte alors l’escalade comme l’envers de sa propre obsession pour l’eau, non plus la quête éperdue de ces “montagnes qui chancellent au milieu de l’océan”, mais la recherche frénétique de vagues tortueuses en forme de pics à gravir. À travers ce récit d’initiation, William Finnegan nous guide dans le monde singulier de la grimpe – des salles d’escalade de New York ou des blocs de Central Park aux parois rocheuses du Vermont ou aux falaises du Mexique et du Canada. Mollie, adolescente douce et ironique, ouvre la voie, et ce qui commence comme un passe-temps pour le père et la fille devient vite une obsession où toute occasion est bonne pour enfiler les chaussons et attaquer les “<i>problèmes</i>’’ sur le mur ou les “<i>itinéraires</i>’’ sur la paroi. Ensemble, ils apprennent un nouveau langage et se forgent de nouveaux souvenirs. À mesure qu’ils se lancent dans des ascensions toujours plus hautes et toujours plus délicates, ils font aussi l’apprentissage d’une notion cardinale : l’expérience du danger, ce que les grimpeurs nomment l’exposition. Et en creux, une leçon de vie simple mais décisive : tomber, c’est être humain. Formidable plongée dans le monde de l’escalade, <i>Avec Mollie</i> offre un regard tendre, bienveillant sur cette relation unique entre un père et une fille.","isbn_10":"2364685729","isbn_13":"9782364685727","asin":"","page_count":94,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=JOYrEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71IYik0SZi89xKhsrdk-hjmSlsBmVWII80Ra4yMZdnUD6bsYal1fuIt7qBTNmN41D8sGo1CBiBfkWyI1-m_RSSZXBTI9ummUdPGw2xN2CJBhz1OUihAQ4JbvGJeez8XmukEoKXY&source=gbs_api","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:09.101272Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:09.438548Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/1vodUptXgU/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/JOYrEAAAQBAJ/avec-mollie"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:12.772673Z","finished_reading_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:26.717952Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:09.108996Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:26.718102Z","user_review":{"id":"y5bE0wN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/y5bE0wN/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":["Page-turner"]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"8eYkz38","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/8eYkz38/","book":{"id":"V8MWpk5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/V8MWpk5/","share_identifier":"8QLkgPrDBS","slug":"le-syndrome-de-palo-alto","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"MJfFDwAAQBAJ","source_etag":"li7MOJ9osVU","title":"Le Syndrome de Palo Alto","subtitle":"roman","authors":["Loïc Hecht"],"publisher":"Editions Léo Scheer","published_date":"2020-01-08","description":"San Francisco, creuset de la révolution numérique qui a déferlé sur nos existences.

Our spirits lift as our mind quietens; our soul is restored by the natural beauty and endurance of the landscape. As we adjust to the rhythm of walking, the earth offers up support and reassurance. In Path, a beautifully written parable from the unique and soulful voice of Louisa Thomsen Brits, a solitary figure walks through uncertainty and isolation to reach an understanding that they are not alone, but part of the world around them.

Quand on boit on est festif, irrévérent, drôle. Français. Un jour pourtant, Claire arrête de boire. Elle prend conscience que cet alcool, prétendument bon-vivant, est en vérité en train de ronger sa vie. Il noyaute ses journées, altère sa pensée, abîme ses relations. En retraçant son passé, elle découvre à quel point l’alcool a été le pilier de sa construction et de son personnage de femme. Sans alcool est le journal de son sevrage. Un chemin tortueux, parfois rocambolesque, à travers son intimité. Une quête de libération complexe, dans un pays qui sanctifie le pinard. L’autrice affronte son passé, l’héritage familial, le jugement des autres. Son récit interroge, au-delà de son expérience. Pourquoi boire est une telle norme sociale ? Alors qu’on lui a toujours vendu la sobriété comme le choix des cons et des culs bénis, elle réalise qu’on l’a sans doute flouée. Être sobre est bien plus subversif qu’elle ne l’imaginait.","isbn_10":"2080232770","isbn_13":"9782080232779","asin":"","page_count":214,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=WKcPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73Hptb2XGltaexzoWw-F-JFCg66h40Iicmz26SO5vJfzOj5bqWs8HbbnNKWwnUgaBdCaKJRG9Rj86MBmLhFTGqYYh2wEmVotqiCJXmDXgTLEj69UpQ3BDzJ1A9XS8zmUw_O3p40&source=gbs_api","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-06-07T20:47:12.755642Z","updated_at":"2021-06-07T20:47:12.970246Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/CbGhCuEe58/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/WKcPEAAAQBAJ/sans-alcool"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2021-06-07T20:47:12.761196Z","finished_reading_at":"2021-06-07T20:47:27.031869Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-06-07T20:47:12.763973Z","updated_at":"2021-06-07T20:47:27.032035Z","user_review":{"id":"JvQkqGN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/JvQkqGN/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":["Page-turner","Inspiring"]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"n82k6GN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/n82k6GN/","book":{"id":"0NYOLbv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/0NYOLbv/","share_identifier":"d7Xv1ooGtc","slug":"encabanee","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"0L8OEAAAQBAJ","source_etag":"3EM7tlMCPfE","title":"Encabanée","subtitle":"","authors":["Gabrielle FILTEAU-CHIBA"],"publisher":"Le Mot et le reste","published_date":"2021-01-07","description":"Lassée de participer au cirque social qu'elle observe quotidiennement à Montréal, Anouk quitte son appartement pour une cabane rustique au Kamouraska, là où naissent les bélugas.

Couper du bois, s'approvisionner en eau, dégager les chemins, les gestes du quotidien deviennent ceux de la survie.

Gabrielle Filteau-Chiba écrit, traduit, illustre et défend la beauté des régions sauvages du Québec. Encabanée, son premier roman inspiré par sa propre vie dans les bois du Kamouraska, a conquis un vaste public ici et à l’étranger.

Il est le garçon en vue du lycée, elle est la solitaire un peu maladroite. Pourtant, l’étincelle se produit : le fils de la femme de ménage et l’intello hautaine connaissent ensemble leur premier amour. Un an plus tard, alors que Marianne s’épanouit au Trinity College de Dublin, Connell s’acclimate mal à la vie universitaire. Un jour, tout est léger, irrésistible ; le lendemain, le drame pointe et les sentiments vacillent. Entre eux, le jeu vient tout juste de commencer. Sally Rooney réussit le tour de force de donner une dimension unique et universelle à cette histoire. Porté par des dialogues saisissants de justesse, Normal People est un roman magistral sur la jeunesse, l’amitié, le sexe, sur les errances affectives et intellectuelles d’une génération qui n’a plus le droit de rêver, mais qui s’entête à espérer.

Hekla, vingt et un ans, emballe quelques affaires, sa machine à écrire, laisse derrière elle la ferme de ses parents et prend le car pour Reykjavík avec quatre manuscrits au fond de sa valise. Il est temps pour elle d’accomplir son destin : elle sera écrivain. Sauf qu’à la capitale, on lui conseille de tenter sa chance à l’élection de Miss Islande au lieu de perdre son temps à noircir du papier. Entre deux petits boulots, Hekla se réfugie chez Ísey, amie d’enfance convertie en mère de famille par un amour de vacances. Ou auprès de Jón John, fils illégitime d’un soldat américain qui rêve de quitter son île pour vivre de stylisme et de l’amour d’un autre homme... Avec la sensibilité, l’humour et la délicatesse qui lui sont si personnels, Auður Ava Ólafsdóttir interroge dans son sixième roman la relation de deux pionniers qui ne tiennent pas dans les cases, prisonniers d’un monde lilliputien et conservateur. Miss Islande est un magnifique roman sur la liberté, la création et l’accomplissement.","isbn_10":"2843048680","isbn_13":"9782843048685","asin":"","page_count":251,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=Ex-tDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE70nY56jX_L8HsAqxBxpxcUcx5InLKf9FWUOxhIrikop1vlyQxcZ1PAkJyeglZSwhZDcN-veXlbbkowiZ9Pvbt4mlSIBj6vtNZksbvnBWE-Wawq-JoCJCRQJJL1h9GOOCMoHxWR6&source=gbs_api","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:59.837674Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:59:00.159114Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/ghQs7wIRef/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/Ex-tDwAAQBAJ/miss-islande"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2021-03-26T18:59:04.288352Z","finished_reading_at":"2021-03-26T18:59:29.719999Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:59.844764Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:59:29.720147Z","user_review":{"id":"BN9exZN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/BN9exZN/","thoughts":"","rating":"3.5","review_tags":["Enriching"]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"2vEW99N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/2vEW99N/","book":{"id":"q5gXeBv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/q5gXeBv/","share_identifier":"yHo4PhF8AB","slug":"surf-city","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THq6p2d3z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Surf City","subtitle":"","authors":["Kem Nunn"],"publisher":"Gallimard, Editions","published_date":"2003-09-01","description":"","isbn_10":"2070304817","isbn_13":"9782070304813","asin":"","page_count":null,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://www.italictype.com/static/images/bookcover-not-found.png","language":"","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:50.865163Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:50.865270Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/yHo4PhF8AB/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THq6p2d3z73P/surf-city"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2021-01-26","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2021-01-26T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:50.888045Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:50.900794Z","user_review":{"id":"0NYodJv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/0NYodJv/","thoughts":"","rating":"3.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":null},{"id":"6vLbkaN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/6vLbkaN/","book":{"id":"r5nGAmv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/r5nGAmv/","share_identifier":"CM7qq28one","slug":"rusty-brown","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THaDssp7z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Rusty Brown","subtitle":"","authors":["Chris Ware"],"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","published_date":"2019-09-24","description":"<b>***FINALIST FOR THE&nbsp;2020 PEN/JEAN STEIN BOOK AWARD***<br /> <br /> ***&nbsp;<i>NEW YORK TIMES</i>&nbsp;100 NOTABLE BOOKS OF THE YEAR ***<br /> <br /> A major graphic novel event more than 18 years in progress: part one of the ongoing bifurcated masterwork from the brilliant and beloved author of <i>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</i> and <i>Building Stories.</i></b><br /> <br /> <i>Rusty Brown</i> is a fully interactive, full-color articulation of the time-space interrelationships of three complete consciousnesses in the first half of a single midwestern American day and the tiny piece of human grit about which they involuntarily orbit.

His new work,<i>Breath</i>, is an extraordinary evocation of an adolescence spent resisting complacency, testing one's limits against nature, finding like-minded souls, and discovering just how far one breath will take you. It's a story of extremes--extreme sports and extreme emotions.</p> <p>On the wild, lonely coast of Western Australia, two thrillseeking and barely adolescent boys fall into the enigmatic thrall of veteran big-wave surfer Sando. Together they form an odd but elite trio. The grown man initiates the boys into a kind of Spartan ethos, a regimen of risk and challenge, where they test themselves in storm swells on remote and shark-infested reefs, pushing each other to the edges of endurance, courage, and sanity. But where is all this heading? Why is their mentor's past such forbidden territory? And what can explain his American wife's peculiar behavior? Venturing beyond all limits--in relationships, in physical challenge, and in sexual behavior--there is a point where oblivion is the only outcome. Full of Winton's lyrical genius for conveying physical sensation, <i>Breath</i> is a rich and atmospheric coming-of-age tale from one of world literature's finest storytellers.</p>","isbn_10":"0374116342","isbn_13":"9780374116347","asin":"","page_count":224,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/3814/9780374116347_c490737f8a8a41b8b57398ecb829c735.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:51.269629Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:51.269650Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/74hJ9B6RLo/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THaD8emrz73P/breath-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2021-01-06","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2021-01-06T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:51.301681Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:51.313666Z","user_review":{"id":"n82abZv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/n82abZv/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"n82eOyv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/n82eOyv/","book":{"id":"JvQ6rY8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/JvQ6rY8/","share_identifier":"vKStSF2YhD","slug":"under-the-stars","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THn9bDxPz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Under the Stars","subtitle":"A Journey into Light","authors":["Matt Gaw"],"publisher":"Elliott & Thompson, Limited","published_date":"2021-09-01","description":"<div>Moonlight, starlight, the ethereal glow of snow in winter.

They showed the world what punk could be, and they continue to spread their message one song, one show, one tour at a time-with no signs of stopping.","isbn_10":"0306922223","isbn_13":"9780306922220","asin":"","page_count":336,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/4270/9780306922220_77e2553023d64f47804e6e689e00fad5.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.137153Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.137180Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/DQawE7KAn1/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THadgYwAz73P/do-what-you-want"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-11-25","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-11-25T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.181010Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.202308Z","user_review":{"id":"k5yXK1N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/k5yXK1N/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"38Go2l8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/38Go2l8/","book":{"id":"E5JEYxN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/E5JEYxN/","share_identifier":"7JqXRIrOor","slug":"the-surfboard","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THn95FeKz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Surfboard","subtitle":"","authors":["Dan Kieran"],"publisher":"Unbound","published_date":"2019-11-12","description":"<i>The Surfboard</i> is Dan Kieran's account of a week he spent in Cornwall building a seven-foot surfboard, even though he had never surfed a day in his life.

As a journalist living in an island community, he had intended to write a light-hearted account of his progress towards surfing nirvana, but instead found himself facing danger, doubt and the spectre of childhood bereavement in an often wild and unwelcoming sea. Meanwhile on land, and back riding a skateboard after a 30-year-gap, David found himself facing bemusement, ridicule and the wrath of the medical profession. But his decision to turn back the clock to the 1970s would also prove remarkably life changing and, occasionally, utterly catastrophic. Warm, funny, touching and honest - with a strong dose of adrenalin - Board explores loss, ego, fear and fatherhood, charting a quest for inner peace against a backdrop of thundering Atlantic waves. At its heart, Board is an inspiring story about accepting some limitations and overcoming others, while completely ignoring common sense and social convention. \"Board tells it as it is. It s like this: don t stand on the sidelines. Don t let society s prejudices stop you living your dreams. Do confront your demons. Do skate, do surf. David Flanagan s tale is an inspirational and honest hymn to getting out there and living your life.\" Alex Wade, author of Amazing Surfing Stories, Surf Nation and Wrecking Machine.</div>","isbn_10":"1905916949","isbn_13":"9781905916948","asin":"","page_count":204,"binding":"E-Book","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/2187/9781905916948_51f9cee2ec1241b9a68062c04c92c779.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.910127Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.910146Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/WxCzB4vuqi/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THo889eKz73P/board"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-11-05","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-11-05T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.929415Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.951705Z","user_review":{"id":"38rQaXv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/38rQaXv/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"q5g0lXv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/q5g0lXv/","book":{"id":"rNw7RNO","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/rNw7RNO/","share_identifier":"JjNUwOpnm3","slug":"the-underground-railroad","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"xYtIDwAAQBAJ","source_etag":"kfil/hPYeEs","title":"The Underground Railroad","subtitle":"","authors":["Colson Whitehead"],"publisher":"Anchor Books, a division of Penguin Random House LLC","published_date":"2018-01-30","description":"<b>#1 <i>New York Times </i>Bestseller - Winner of the Pulitzer Prize - Winner of the National Book Award - Winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction - Longlisted for the Man Booker Prize <p> One of the Best books of the Year: <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post, </i>NPR<i>, The Boston Globe, The Seattle Times, HuffPost, Esquire, Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></b><br> <b><i> </i></b><br> <b>Look for Whitehead's acclaimed new novel, <i>The Nickel Boys, </i>available now!</b> <p>Cora is a young slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. An outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is on the cusp of womanhood--where greater pain awaits. And so when Caesar, a slave who has recently arrived from Virginia, urges her to join him on the Underground Railroad, she seizes the opportunity and escapes with him. In Colson Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor: engineers and conductors operate a secret network of actual tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora embarks on a harrowing flight from one state to the next, encountering, like Gulliver, strange yet familiar iterations of her own world at each stop. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the terrors of the antebellum era, he weaves in the saga of our nation, from the brutal abduction of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. <i>The Underground Railroad </i>is both the gripping tale of one woman's will to escape the horrors of bondage--and a powerful meditation on the history we all share.","isbn_10":"0345804325","isbn_13":"9780345804327","asin":"","page_count":338,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=xYtIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE714I-oNQnfGKellzLOcnQyyt0c99QFL632Nxyn4wKUTDm1O46C3ESe5BnuFN4tNtau0cFC9EJYOIfFwY7PD_AUP3W9RGgdpyFfVvYlLfT5qGqnkC1JYCL0EdTz4Su6_tRRsQyK8&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2019-11-02T15:15:10.305755Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T02:19:54.033088Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/JjNUwOpnm3/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/xYtIDwAAQBAJ/the-underground-railroad"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-10-31","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-10-31T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:57.053865Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:57.168030Z","user_review":{"id":"bv0omw5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/bv0omw5/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"E83eQp5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/E83eQp5/","book":{"id":"0vaRbB8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/0vaRbB8/","share_identifier":"CdE2t80kRH","slug":"utopia-for-realists-1","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"psA_DgAAQBAJ","source_etag":"2T5gWeqdRys","title":"Utopia for Realists","subtitle":"How We Can Build the Ideal World","authors":["Rutger Bregman"],"publisher":"Little, Brown","published_date":"2017-03-14","description":"<b>Universal basic income. A 15-hour workweek. Open borders. Does it sound too good to be true? One of Europe's leading young thinkers shows how we can build an ideal world today.</b><br><br> \"A more politically radical Malcolm Gladwell.\" -- <i>New York Times</i><br><br> After working all day at jobs we often dislike, we buy things we don't need. Rutger Bregman, a Dutch historian, reminds us it needn't be this way -- and in some places it isn't. Rutger Bregman's TED Talk about universal basic income seemed impossibly radical when he delivered it in 2014. A quarter of a million views later, the subject of that video is being seriously considered by leading economists and government leaders the world over. It's just one of the many utopian ideas that Bregman proves is possible today. <br><br><i>Utopia for Realists</i> is one of those rare books that takes you by surprise and challenges what you think can happen. From a Canadian city that once completely eradicated poverty, to Richard Nixon's near implementation of a basic income for millions of Americans, Bregman takes us on a journey through history, and beyond the traditional left-right divides, as he champions ideas whose time have come. <br><br> Every progressive milestone of civilization -- from the end of slavery to the beginning of democracy -- was once considered a utopian fantasy. Bregman's book, both challenging and bracing, demonstrates that new utopian ideas, like the elimination of poverty and the creation of the fifteen-hour workweek, can become a reality in our lifetime. Being unrealistic and unreasonable can in fact make the impossible inevitable, and it is the only way to build the ideal world.","isbn_10":"0316471909","isbn_13":"9780316471909","asin":"","page_count":218,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=psA_DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73Zbz1YixTFUSi-ME_vde6daw7QibcyOzqeYHgQHsoTFP_3Q_TNgQJnk1ssLHbCFvb_AO4_P50qZ_yxkGPMFH1aoErA7oXyfXVcM6ix8jXU4FM_X-VuNOstlc2Bv6dFXVXXhpYO&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-01-14T17:01:02.153528Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T17:01:02.616565Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/CdE2t80kRH/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/psA_DgAAQBAJ/utopia-for-realists-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-10-16","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-10-16T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:57.754248Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:57.784286Z","user_review":{"id":"y5bdVo8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/y5bdVo8/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"n84axYN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/n84axYN/","book":{"id":"0NY6db5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/0NY6db5/","share_identifier":"s20UTHRCNi","slug":"the-sea-around-us","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1TH9hKPayz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Sea Around Us","subtitle":"","authors":["Jeffrey S.

Rachel Carson's rare ability to combine scientific insight with moving, poetic prose catapulted her book to first place on The New York Times best-seller list, where itenjoyed wide attention for thirty-one consecutive weeks. It remained on the list for more than a year and a half and ultimately sold well over a million copies, has been translated into 28 languages, inspired an Academy Award-winning documentary, and won both the 1952 National Book Award and theJohn Burroughs Medal.This classic work remains as fresh today as when it first appeared. Carson's writing teems with stunning, memorable images--the newly formed Earth cooling beneath an endlessly overcast sky; the centuries of nonstop rain that created the oceans; giant squids battling sperm whales hundreds offathoms below the surface; and incredibly powerful tides moving 100 billion tons of water daily in the Bay of Fundy. Quite simply, she captures the mystery and allure of the ocean with a compelling blend of imagination and expertise.Reintroducing a classic work to a whole new generation of readers, this Special Edition features a new chapter written by Jeffrey Levinton, a leading expert in marine ecology, that brings the scientific side of The Sea Around Us completely up to date. Levinton incorporates the most recentthinking on continental drift, coral reefs, the spread of the ocean floor, the deterioration of the oceans, mass extinction of sea life, and many other topics. In addition, acclaimed nature writer Ann Zwinger has contributed a brief foreword.Today, with the oceans endangered by the dumping of medical waste and ecological disasters such as the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, this illuminating volume provides a timely reminder of both the fragility and the importance of the ocean and the life that abounds within it. Anyone who loves thesea, or who is concerned about our natural environment, will want to read this classic work.","isbn_10":"0195069978","isbn_13":"9780195069976","asin":"","page_count":288,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/547/9780195069976_af2c198db24049df8f59cfc0aabc2755.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:57.919867Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:57.919887Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/s20UTHRCNi/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1TH9hKPayz73P/the-sea-around-us"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-10-10","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-10-10T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:57.950158Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:57.975725Z","user_review":{"id":"0valj25","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/0valj25/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"nvxEoV8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/nvxEoV8/","book":{"id":"rNwGxRN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/rNwGxRN/","share_identifier":"pHQOQ7nFlK","slug":"the-divine-song","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THekgr2Kz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Divine Song","subtitle":"","authors":["David Ball (Translator)","Abdourahman A.

In Sammy, we recognize the African American singer-composer, poet, and novelist Gil Scott-Heron who is best known for his song \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.\" &nbsp;<br /> &#8203;<i>The Divine Song</i> takes us from the shores of Africa to Sammy's ancestors' arrival in the Americas in the hold of the slave ships. From there, Abdourahman A. Waberi takes the characters from Tennessee--under the tutelage of Lili Williams, Sammy's beloved African-born grandmother--to New York and the concert halls of Paris and Berlin, wherever blues and jazz find an enchanted audience. African tales, religious practices, segregation, the civil rights movement, addiction, and jail--Sammy's life comes to encompass the whole of the African American experience. At a time when social and racial divisions have yet again come into sharp relief, this lyrical novel by one of African literature's rising stars is necessary reading for anyone who celebrates the resilience of art.&nbsp;</div>","isbn_10":"085742694X","isbn_13":"9780857426949","asin":"","page_count":216,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/4818/9780857426949_08338b12047c47599b5ec1311ebb66f5.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:59.114192Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:59.114212Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/pHQOQ7nFlK/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THekgr2Kz73P/the-divine-song"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-09-25","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-09-25T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:59.147947Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:59.172432Z","user_review":{"id":"nvxqmq8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/nvxqmq8/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"gNqX1w8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/gNqX1w8/","book":{"id":"q8W0eNE","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/q8W0eNE/","share_identifier":"vqpTGpwnbf","slug":"inconspicuous-consumption","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"X0d9DwAAQBAJ","source_etag":"eRxnZsSJ0VQ","title":"Inconspicuous Consumption","subtitle":"The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have","authors":["Tatiana Schlossberg"],"publisher":"Grand Central Publishing","published_date":"2019-08-27","description":"<b><b>\"A compelling-and illuminating-look at how our daily habits impact the environment.\"--<i>Vanity Fair</i></b><br><br> <b>\"If you're looking for something to cling to in what often feels like a hopeless conversation, Schlossberg's darkly humorous, knowledge-is-power, eyes-wide-open approach may be just the thing.\"--<i>Vogue</i></b><br><br> <b>\"Shows how even the smallest decisions can have profound environmental consequences.\"<i>--The New York Times</i></b><br><br> </b>From a former <i>New York Times </i>science writer, this urgent call to action will empower you to stand up to climate change and environmental pollution by making simple but impactful everyday choices.<b><br><br></b>With urgency and wit, Tatiana Schlossberg explains that far from being only a distant problem of the natural world created by the fossil fuel industry, climate change is all around us, all the time, lurking everywhere in our convenience-driven society, all without our realizing it.<br><br> By examining the unseen and unconscious environmental impacts in four areas-the Internet and technology, food, fashion, and fuel - Schlossberg helps readers better understand why climate change is such a complicated issue, and how it connects all of us: How streaming a movie on Netflix in New York burns coal in Virginia; how eating a hamburger in California might contribute to pollution in the Gulf of Mexico; how buying an inexpensive cashmere sweater in Chicago expands the Mongolian desert; how destroying forests from North Carolina is necessary to generate electricity in England.<br><br> Cataloging the complexities and frustrations of our carbon-intensive society with a dry sense of humor, Schlossberg makes the climate crisis and its solutions interesting and relevant to everyone who cares, even a little, about the planet. She empowers readers to think about their stuff and the environment in a new way, helping them make more informed choices when it comes to the future of our world.<br><br> Most importantly, this is a book about the power we have as voters and consumers to make sure that the fight against climate change includes all of us and all of our stuff, not just industry groups and politicians.

By midyear, a widely reported accident jeopardized the survival of both. And in his months of recovery, the link between writing and living became more crucial than ever. Rarely has a book on writing been so clear, so useful, and so revealing. On Writing begins with a mesmerizing account of King's childhood and his uncannily early focus on writing to tell a story. A series of vivid memories from adolescence, college, and the struggling years that led up to his first novel, Carrie, will afford readers a fresh and often very funny perspective on the formation of a writer. King next turns to the basic tools of his trade -- how to sharpen and multiply them through use, and how the writer must always have them close at hand. He takes the reader through crucial aspects of the writer's art and life, offering practical and inspiring advice on everything from plot and character development to work habits and rejection. Serialized in the New Yorker to vivid acclaim, On Writing culminates with a profoundly moving account of how King's overwhelming need to write spurred him toward recovery, and brought him back to his life. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower--and entertain--everyone who reads it.","isbn_10":"1444723251","isbn_13":"9781444723250","asin":"","page_count":351,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=gsFl5AAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71xLRXwQHaIUtAm6dJ16j-z1_qdV9NF17ajLK-eFC7ecuOtuDJ4T5u4dTvJ6PE0S3QYIBjdPtiE3QtenZB6J_uIZhkCd0eGgjJ6uiB8ofz4MQpWmC6fEaiDMaDLrzxUstQqOpyZ&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2020-06-06T20:13:52.514871Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T20:13:52.723600Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/QWfWoiTGM6/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/gsFl5AAACAAJ/on-writing"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-06-17","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-06-17T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:01.060398Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:01.087667Z","user_review":{"id":"BN9elxN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/BN9elxN/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"q8W3Or8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/q8W3Or8/","book":{"id":"1NmEMXN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/1NmEMXN/","share_identifier":"1kdiJw66KN","slug":"there-is-no-planet-b","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THh5ow5Fz73P","source_etag":"","title":"There Is No Planet B","subtitle":"A Handbook for the Make or Break Years","authors":["Mike Berners-Lee"],"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","published_date":"2019-02-28","description":"Feeding the world, climate change, biodiversity, antibiotics, plastics - the list of concerns seems endless.

Marie Kondo and other decluttering gurus promise that shedding our stuff will solve our problems. We commit to cleanse diets and strive for inbox zero. Amid the frantic pace and distraction of everyday life, we covet silence-and airy, Instagrammable spaces in which to enjoy it. The popular term for this brand of upscale austerity, “minimalism,” has mostly come to stand for things to buy and consume. But minimalism has richer, deeper, and altogether more valuable gifts to offer. <br> <br>Kyle Chayka is one of our sharpest cultural observers. After spending years covering minimalist trends for leading publications, he now delves beneath this lifestyle's glossy surface, seeking better ways to claim the time and space we crave. He shows that our longing for less goes back further than we realize. His search leads him to the philosophical and spiritual origins of minimalism, and to the stories of artists such as Agnes Martin and Donald Judd; composers such as John Cage and Julius Eastman; architects and designers; visionaries and misfits. As Chayka looks anew at their extraordinary lives and explores the places where they worked-from Manhattan lofts to the Texas high desert and the back alleys of Kyoto-he reminds us that what we most require is presence, not absence. The result is an elegant new synthesis of our minimalist desires and our profound emotional needs.","isbn_10":"1635572118","isbn_13":"9781635572117","asin":"","page_count":183,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z_OhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73I3E_J0kPuKaRZI_FCmSdG6RDm_kDPr78TuG2d3ZJhqmgIw5LVz87eNDvTqfmkkbVtUHAn9ejGHAIKnYvAidM7stXPVsW3yvnRmloVE-JTWGgxfkL608cKxvcnSPFO3Wx69omN&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2020-01-10T21:57:15.962304Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T21:57:16.309965Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/Z5av7WlImQ/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/Z_OhDwAAQBAJ/the-longing-for-less"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-02-12","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-02-12T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:04.815758Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:04.873856Z","user_review":{"id":"0NYoDbv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/0NYoDbv/","thoughts":"A few good portraits. <br/>I came for the minimalism, stayed for the stories.<br/>I laughed and enjoyed the historical touches.<br/><br/>I don’t think I like the almost condescending tone it can come around for current minimalists but I definitively liked the lesson on the sources of this movement.","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"gNqXdw8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/gNqXdw8/","book":{"id":"y5bdaG8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/y5bdaG8/","share_identifier":"89TtpWBCni","slug":"the-salt-path","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1TH90hpDwz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Salt Path","subtitle":"A Memoir","authors":["Raynor Winn"],"publisher":"Penguin Publishing Group","published_date":"2019-03-05","description":"<b>\"Polished, poignant... an inspiring story of true love.\"--<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br /> <br /> A BEST BOOK OF 2019,&nbsp;NPR's Book Concierge<br /> SHORTLISTED FOR THE COSTA BOOK AWARD<br /> OVER 400,000 COPIES SOLD WORLDWIDE<br /> <br /> The true story of a couple who lost everything and embarked on a transformative journey walking the South West Coast Path in England</b><br /> <br /> Just days after Raynor Winn learns that Moth, her husband of thirty-two years, is terminally ill, their house and farm are taken away, along with their livelihood.

In its determination to preserve the century of revolution, Gale initiated a revolution of its own: digitization of epic proportions to preserve these invaluable works in the largest archive of its kind. Now for the first time these high-quality digital copies of original 18th century manuscripts are available in print, making them highly accessible to libraries, undergraduate students, and independent scholars.<br /> Western literary study flows out of eighteenth-century works by Alexander Pope, Daniel Defoe, Henry Fielding, Frances Burney, Denis Diderot, Johann Gottfried Herder, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and others.

Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.</b><br /> <br /> In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of <i>Deep Work</i> introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives.<br /> <br /> Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience \"fear of missing out\" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction.<br /> <br /> Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions.<br /> <br /> Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day \"digital declutter\" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.<br /> <br /> Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you. This book shows the way.","isbn_10":"0525536515","isbn_13":"9780525536512","asin":"","page_count":304,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/3017/9780525536512_0bf2aecf00b749f088e12cb4971be014.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T17:33:23.320474Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T17:33:23.320498Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/HG4msiNaoe/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THbR2RpLz73P/digital-minimalism-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2019-12-15","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2019-12-15T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:05.711248Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:05.763895Z","user_review":{"id":"Y8dXl38","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/Y8dXl38/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"q8W3ar8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/q8W3ar8/","book":{"id":"E5JEbxN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/E5JEbxN/","share_identifier":"zA86sNrvFP","slug":"in-waves","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THo9Rotmz73P","source_etag":"","title":"In Waves","subtitle":"","authors":["A.

In his new book, <i>Stillness Is the Key</i>, Holiday draws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those charging ahead.</b><br> <br> All great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes, and visionaries share one indelible quality. It enables them to conquer their tempers. To avoid distraction and discover great insights. To achieve happiness and do the right thing. Ryan Holiday calls it stillness--to be steady while the world spins around you.<br> <br> In this book, he outlines a path for achieving this ancient, but urgently necessary way of living. Drawing on a wide range of history's greatest thinkers, from Confucius to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius to Thich Nhat Hanh, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, he argues that stillness is not mere inactivity, but the doorway to self-mastery, discipline, and focus.<br> <br> Holiday also examines figures who exemplified the power of stillness: baseball player Sadaharu Oh, whose study of Zen made him the greatest home run hitter of all time; Winston Churchill, who in balancing his busy public life with time spent laying bricks and painting at his Chartwell estate managed to save the world from annihilation in the process; Fred Rogers, who taught generations of children to see what was invisible to the eye; Anne Frank, whose journaling and love of nature guided her through unimaginable adversity.<br> <br> More than ever, people are overwhelmed. They face obstacles and egos and competition. <i>Stillness Is the Key</i> offers a simple but inspiring antidote to the stress of 24/7 news and social media. The stillness that we all seek is the path to meaning, contentment, and excellence in a world that needs more of it than ever.","isbn_10":"0525538585","isbn_13":"9780525538585","asin":"","page_count":290,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=4BmtDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71I5CtAyS041Cgmy_XLTsISsWOCzZl7Q-ugCcD9tELTJ6A1lZtbmQTH4Yij3Ie8WMVur1YXobzkmJDjCsOoOk04B64rICHQC9DQH6mqxqraDlPH7UJgMCYA5h6LvBxzkRrleGmC&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-01-22T20:00:13.580558Z","updated_at":"2021-01-22T20:00:14.006740Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/VaOkSlxPp6/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/4BmtDwAAQBAJ/stillness-is-the-key"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2019-12-08","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2019-12-08T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:05.503320Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:05.539947Z","user_review":{"id":"ZNB6ZkN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/ZNB6ZkN/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"ZNBMXR8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/ZNBMXR8/","book":{"id":"x57ebj8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/x57ebj8/","share_identifier":"mSZ1XQHwT0","slug":"you-are-a-badass-1","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THdA05D1z73P","source_etag":"","title":"You Are a Badass®","subtitle":"How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life","authors":["Jen Sincero"],"publisher":"Running Press","published_date":"2013-04-23","description":"<div> <div><b>Packed with humor, inspiration, and advice, <i>You Are a Badass</i> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling self-help book that teaches you how to get better without getting busted.</b></div> <br /> <div>In this refreshingly entertaining how-to guide, bestselling author and world-traveling success coach, Jen Sincero, serves up twenty-seven bite-sized chapters full of hilariously inspiring stories, sage advice, easy exercises, and the occasional swear word, helping you to:</div> <div> <ul> <li>Identify and change the self-sabotaging beliefs and behaviors that stop you from getting what you want,</li> <li>Create a life you totally love.

His idea was to walk through the country, earning money for food by playing his violin in bars and plazas.</p> <p>Nearly a century later, the book Laurie Lee wrote - As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning - inspired Alastair Humphreys. It made him fall in love with Spain - the landscapes and the spirit - and with Laurie's style of travel. He travelled slow, lived simply, slept on hilltops, relished spontaneity, and loved conversations with the different people he met along the hot and dusty road.</p> <p>For 15 years, Alastair dreamed of retracing Laurie Lee's footsteps, but could never get past the hurdle of being distinctly unmusical. This year, he decided to go anyway. The journey was his most terrifying yet, risking failure and humiliation every day, and finding himself truly vulnerable to the rhythms of the road and of his own life. But along the way, he found humility, redemption and triumph.

In the previous books, his childhood was complicated by the pull of his two cultures--French and Syrian--and his parents' deteriorating relationship. Now his father, Adbel-Razak, has left to take a job in Saudi Arabia, and after making a pilgrimage to Mecca, turns increasingly towards religion. But after following him from place to place and living for years under the harsh conditions of his impoverished village, Riad's mother Clementine has hadenough. Refusing to live in a country where women have no rights, she returns with her children to live in France with her own mother... until Abdel-Razak shows up unexpectedly to drag the family on yet another journey.</p> <p>As the series builds to a climax, we see Riad struggle with problems both universal (bullies at school) and specific (his mother's sudden illness, the judgment of his religious relatives).

While putting one arm over the other, sometimes resting on his back, Minihane begins to confront the often buried issues in his life. Along the way, he rekindles old friendships and forges new ones, and after an unexpected setback discovers that he has already gained enough strength to be able to continue his recovery on dry land. The activity that he describes is both strange and beautiful, as the wild water puts him in touch with nature and himself.Floating is a remarkable memoir about, on the surface, a passion for swimming and nature. Moving from darkness into light, it is as intense and moving as it is lyrical and generous. It captures in memorable detail Minihane's struggle to understand his life and move forward and, steeped in the anti-authoritarian and naturalistic spirit of Roger Deakin, celebrates the joy of taking time out to feel better.From Hampstead to Yorkshire, from Dorset to Jura, from the Isles of Scilly to Wales--with this book, Joe Minihane has written what is often a love letter to different wild stretches of water. We swim with him through ponds and lakes, rivers and canals, lodes and marshes, even the ice-cold sea. With him, we too finally come out of the water and dry ourselves off.</div>","isbn_10":"1468314920","isbn_13":"9781468314922","asin":"","page_count":272,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/3415/9781468314922_0a49d3ca159b4413b953b8f6ec49cba9.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:15.381510Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:15.381530Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/FsguSzPHM4/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THjHdKPgz73P/floating"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2018-11-04","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2018-11-04T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:15.404654Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:15.453548Z","user_review":{"id":"k5yXAlN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/k5yXAlN/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"r5nRnV5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/r5nRnV5/","book":{"id":"gNqmQdN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/gNqmQdN/","share_identifier":"830jcz3luu","slug":"last-frontier","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THbgwZBkz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Last Frontier","subtitle":"","authors":["Howard Fast"],"publisher":"Penguin Publishing Group","published_date":"1971-01-01","description":"","isbn_10":"0451056426","isbn_13":"9780451056429","asin":"","page_count":null,"binding":"Mass Market","cover_image_url":"https://www.italictype.com/static/images/bookcover-not-found.png","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:15.701912Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:15.701930Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/830jcz3luu/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THbgwZBkz73P/last-frontier"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2018-10-11","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2018-10-11T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:15.728185Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:15.774484Z","user_review":{"id":"x57e3x8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/x57e3x8/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":null},{"id":"38rpnq5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/38rpnq5/","book":{"id":"E83zwXv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/E83zwXv/","share_identifier":"DKBTRMiRkG","slug":"the-pull-of-the-river","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THn9bBfEz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Pull of the River","subtitle":"A Journey into the Wild and Watery Heart of Britain","authors":["Matt Gaw"],"publisher":"Elliott & Thompson, Limited","published_date":"2018-04-05","description":"Tales of escape and adventure on Britain's waterwaysIn The Pull of the River two foolhardy explorers do what we would all love to do: they turn their world upside down and seek adventure on their very own doorstep.In a handsome, homemade canoe, painted a joyous nautical red the colour of Mae West's lips, Matt and his friend James delve into a watery landscape that invites us to see the world through new eyes.Over chalk, gravel, clay and mud;

With Butcher&#8217;s Crossing, his fiercely intelligent, beautifully written western, Williams dismantles the myths of modern America.<br /> <br /> It is the 1870s, and Will Andrews, &#64257;red up by Emerson to seek &#8220;an original relation to nature,&#8221; drops out of Harvard and heads west. He washes up in Butcher&#8217;s Crossing, a small Kansas town on the outskirts of nowhere. <i>Butcher&#8217;s Crossing</i> is full of restless men looking for ways to make money and ways to waste it. Before long Andrews strikes up a friendship with one of them, a man who regales Andrews with tales of immense herds of buffalo, ready for the taking, hidden away in a beautiful valley deep in the Colorado Rockies. He convinces Andrews to join in an expedition to track the animals down. The journey out is grueling, but at the end is a place of paradisal richness. Once there, however, the three men abandon themselves to an orgy of slaughter, so caught up in killing buffalo that they lose all sense of time. Winter soon overtakes them: they are snowed in. Next spring, half-insane with cabin fever, cold, and hunger, they stagger back to Butcher&#8217;s Crossing to &#64257;nd a world as irremediably changed as they have been.","isbn_10":"1590171985","isbn_13":"9781590171981","asin":"","page_count":296,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/1149/9781590171981_b3ada96b23d94185a86608b76d2b2f96.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T16:48:06.263338Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T16:48:06.263357Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/Ia02Mrojjh/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THkB5eE6z73P/butchers-crossing"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2018-04-08","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2018-04-08T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:19.249878Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:19.294559Z","user_review":{"id":"nvxqL68","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/nvxqL68/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"oNKym7v","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/oNKym7v/","book":{"id":"0NY66K5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/0NY66K5/","share_identifier":"2EgtWDJBXi","slug":"la-desobeissance-civile","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THmFDxdwz73P","source_etag":"","title":"La désobéissance Civile","subtitle":"","authors":["Henry David Thoreau"],"publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","published_date":"2018-09-03","description":"La Désobéissance civile, titre original Civil Disobedience est un essai de Henry David Thoreau publié en 1849.

Surfing only looks like a sport. To initiates, it is something else: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. <p>Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. <i>Barbarian Days</i> takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses--off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships forged in challenging waves. <p>Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites-only gang in a tough school in Honolulu. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly--he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui--is served up with rueful humor. As Finnegan's travels take him ever farther afield, he discovers the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissects the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, and navigates the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity. <p><i>Barbarian Days </i>is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little-understood art. <p><b>Praise for <i>Barbarian Days</i> </b> <p>\"Without a doubt, the finest surf book I've ever read . . . But on a more fundamental level, <i>Barbarian Days</i> offers a clear-eyed vision of American boyhood. Like Jon Krakauer's <i>Into the Wild</i>, it is a sympathetic examination of what happens when literary ideas of freedom and purity take hold of a young mind and fling his body out into the far reaches of the world.\"<i>--The New York Times Magazine</i><br><i> </i><br>\"Incandescent . . .

In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back. <br> <br><i>Ego Is the Enemy </i>draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to his­tory. We meet fascinating figures such as George Marshall, Jackie Robinson, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, who all reached the highest levels of power and success by con­quering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well. <br> <br>In an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion, the battle against ego must be fought on many fronts. Armed with the lessons in this book, as Holiday writes, “you will be less invested in the story you tell about your own specialness, and as a result, you will be liberated to accomplish the world-changing work you’ve set out to achieve.”</p>","isbn_10":"069819215X","isbn_13":"9780698192157","asin":"","page_count":258,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=j0GXCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73vzZ5LYeNUDQJaHTxwJiYyWXHqBi6Gsb3rMy6QnU-rrwBTgo4GxKjtEpFyUVnbFklOuGss4edaxIdIUAiktDQztuQhU8pnz5eLxNNGAsdi0L0G2mUMxXd3Oa4z0EDUAPj7SDKp&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2020-06-06T08:21:49.595895Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T02:19:57.566001Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/hLn2BGh4Nm/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/j0GXCgAAQBAJ/ego-is-the-enemy"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2018-01-02","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2018-01-02T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:21.250056Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:21.296419Z","user_review":{"id":"E83gzX8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/E83gzX8/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"Y8d0K08","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/Y8d0K08/","book":{"id":"rNwGGAN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/rNwGGAN/","share_identifier":"6w4mYeepTK","slug":"into-the-forest","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THc5rqu4z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Into the Forest","subtitle":"A Novel","authors":["Jean Hegland"],"publisher":"Random House Publishing Group","published_date":"1998-09-01","description":"<b>NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE *&nbsp;Set in the near-future, <i>Into the Forest</i> is a powerfully imagined novel that focuses on the relationship between two teenage sisters living alone in their Northern California forest home.<br /></b><br /> Over 30 miles from the nearest town, and several miles away from their nearest neighbor, Nell and Eva struggle to survive as society begins to decay and collapse around them.

Eloquent... A heart-rending drama of human yearning.\" --<i>New York Times</i></b><br /> <br /> In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter.&nbsp;&nbsp;How&nbsp;Christopher Johnson McCandless&nbsp;came to die is the unforgettable story of <i>Into the Wild</i>.<br /> <br /> Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.<br /> <br /> Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless's short life. Admitting an interst that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the dries and desires that propelled McCandless. Digging deeply, he takes an inherently compelling mystery and unravels the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind; the complex, charged bond between fathers and sons.<br /> <br /> When McCandless's innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naiveté, pretensions, and hubris. He is said to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless's uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity, and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding--and not an ounce of sentimentality. Mesmerizing, heartbreaking, <i>Into the Wild</i> is a <i>tour de force</i>. The power and luminosity of Jon Krakauer's stoytelling blaze through every page.","isbn_10":"0385486804","isbn_13":"9780385486804","asin":"","page_count":240,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/423/9780385486804_28343774f85c4996867498f6f0410fde.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-25T16:01:59.745132Z","updated_at":"2021-03-25T16:01:59.745150Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/ERceclm9EQ/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THaHTYAmz73P/into-the-wild"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2017-11-14","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2017-11-14T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:22.489686Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:22.531321Z","user_review":{"id":"O8oglL8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/O8oglL8/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"r5nRYV5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/r5nRYV5/","book":{"id":"zNpPPgN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/zNpPPgN/","share_identifier":"U2I9appelY","slug":"simplicity-parenting","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THipf50Kz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Simplicity Parenting","subtitle":"Using the Extraordinary Power of Less to Raise Calmer, Happier, and More Secure Kids","authors":["Kim John Payne","Lisa M.

Wild is angry, brave, sad, self-knowing, redemptive, raw, compelling, and brilliantly written, and I think it's destined to be loved by a lot of people, men and women, for a very long time.' --Nick Hornby<br /> <br /> At twenty-six, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother's rapid death from cancer, her family disbanded and her marriage crumbled. With nothing to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to walk eleven-hundred miles of the west coast of America - from the Mojave Desert, through California and Oregon, and into Washington state - and to do it alone. She had no experience of long-distance hiking and the journey was nothing more than a line on a map. But it held a promise - a promise of piecing together a life that lay in ruins at her feet.<br /> <br /> Strayed's account captures the agonies - both mental and physical - of her incredible journey; how it maddened and terrified her, and how, ultimately, it healed her. Wild is a brutal memoir of survival, grief and redemption: a searing portrayal of life at its lowest ebb and at its highest tide.","isbn_10":"0857897772","isbn_13":"9780857897770","asin":"","page_count":300,"binding":"E-Book","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/1152/9780857897770_bf77d7cf61fa41be8e13feb498fb0448.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:23.136567Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:23.136587Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/aJydj0kcsN/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THeknPq7z73P/wild-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2017-10-15","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2017-10-15T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:23.158982Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:23.200474Z","user_review":{"id":"q8W1295","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/q8W1295/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"bv0pdDv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/bv0pdDv/","book":{"id":"1NmEEGN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/1NmEEGN/","share_identifier":"8HP573LYl8","slug":"saltwater-buddha","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THemTK45z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Saltwater Buddha","subtitle":"A Surfer's Quest to Find Zen on the Sea","authors":["Jaimal Yogis"],"publisher":"Wisdom Publications","published_date":"2009-04-10","description":"Fed up with teenage life in the suburbs, Jaimal Yogis ran off to Hawaii with little more than a copy of Hermann Hesse's <i>Siddhartha</i> and enough cash for a surfboard.

Twenty-something, suit-clad, and upwardly mobile, Joshua Fields Millburn thought he had everything anyone could ever want. Until he didn't anymore. Blindsided by the loss of his mother and his marriage in the same month, Millburn started questioning every aspect of the life he had built for himself. Then, he accidentally discovered a lifestyle known as minimalism...and everything started to change. That was four years ago. Since, Millburn, now 32, has embraced simplicity. In the pursuit of looking for something more substantial than compulsory consumption and the broken American Dream, he jettisoned most of his material possessions, paid off loads of crippling debt, and walked away from his six-figure career. So, when everything was gone, what was left? Not a how-to book but a why-to book, Everything That Remains is the touching, surprising story of what happened when one young man decided to let go of everything and begin living more deliberately. Heartrending, uplifting, and deeply personal, this engrossing memoir is peppered with insightful (and often hilarious) interruptions by Ryan Nicodemus, Millburn's best friend of twenty years.","isbn_10":"1938793188","isbn_13":"9781938793189","asin":"","page_count":null,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/5765/9781938793189_b453476ba0e74704861d7fb8dbe435f4.jpg","language":"","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:26.746762Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:26.746782Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/FMA3YqbplJ/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THoj9pbjz73P/everything-that-remains"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2017-05-02","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2017-05-02T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:26.770540Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:26.821817Z","user_review":{"id":"38GnLgv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/38GnLgv/","thoughts":"An easy to read memoir. <br/>I especially like the conversation through footnotes.<br/>","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":null},{"id":"dvZ49rN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/dvZ49rN/","book":{"id":"0NY03K8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/0NY03K8/","share_identifier":"HhVKQyYoU9","slug":"the-managers-path","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"zqNaDgAAQBAJ","source_etag":"EsYuDLqQ9Lw","title":"The Manager's Path","subtitle":"A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change","authors":["Camille Fournier"],"publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","published_date":"2017-03-13","description":"<p>Managing people is difficult wherever you work.

A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure, involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.</p> <p>We all have a voice in our head. It's what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we're not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we're stuck with this voice - that there's nothing we can do to rein it in - but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It's a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead, it's something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation.

Martin</b><br /> <br /> From online entertainment pioneer, actress, and \"queen of the geeks\" Felicia Day, <i>You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost)</i> is a \"relentlessly funny and surprisingly inspirational\" (Forbes.com), memoir about her unusual upbringing, her rise to internet stardom, and embracing her weirdness to find her place in the world.<br /> <br /> When Felicia Day was a girl, all she wanted was to connect with other kids (desperately). Growing up in the Deep South, where she was \"home-schooled for hippie reasons,\" she looked online to find her tribe. The internet was in its infancy and she became an early adopter at every stage of its growth--finding joy and unlikely friendships in the emerging digital world. Her relative isolation meant that she could pursue passions like gaming, calculus, and 1930's detective novels without shame. Because she had no idea how \"uncool\" she really was.<br /> <br /> But if it hadn't been for her strange background-- the awkwardness continued when she started college at sixteen, with Mom driving her to campus every day--she might never have had the naive confidence to forge her own path. Like when she graduated as valedictorian with a math degree and then headed to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting despite having zero contacts. Or when she tired of being typecast as the crazy cat-lady secretary and decided to create her own web series before people in show business understood that online video could be more than just cats chasing laser pointers.<br /> <br /> Felicia's rags-to-riches rise to internet fame launched her career as one of the most influen­tial creators in new media. Ever candid, she opens up about the rough patches along the way, recounting battles with writer's block, a full-blown gaming addiction, severe anxiety and depression--and how she reinvented herself when overachieving became overwhelming.<br /> <br /> Showcasing Felicia's \"engaging and often hilarious voice\" (<i>USA TODAY</i>), <i>You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost)</i> is proof that everyone should celebrate what makes them different and be brave enough to share it with the world, because anything is possible now--even for a digital misfit.","isbn_10":"1476785651","isbn_13":"9781476785653","asin":"","page_count":272,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/2879/9781476785653_539bc62826e147b4a99f9eea1ee85a77.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:25.178382Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:25.178405Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/sSfNlnJh4R/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THjL8BP6z73P/youre-never-weird-on-the-internet-almost"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2017-03-06","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2017-03-06T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:25.204515Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:25.247614Z","user_review":null,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"oNKydOv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/oNKydOv/","book":{"id":"dNV22MN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/dNV22MN/","share_identifier":"uIlqPSDu2B","slug":"the-big-tiny","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THaQoounz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Big Tiny","subtitle":"A Built-It-Myself Memoir","authors":["Dee Williams"],"publisher":"Penguin Publishing Group","published_date":"2014-04-22","description":"Dee Williams's life changed in an instant, with a near-death experience in the aisle of her local grocery store. Diagnosed with a heart condition at age forty-one, she was all too suddenly reminded that life is short, time is precious, and she wanted to be spending hers with the people and things she truly loved. That included the beautiful sprawling house in the Pacific Northwest she had painstakingly restored--but, increasingly, it did not include the mortgage payments, constant repairs, and general time-suck of home ownership. A new sense of clarity began to take hold: Just what was all this <i>stuff</i> for? Multiple extra rooms, a kitchen stocked with rarely used appliances, were things that couldn't compare with the financial freedom and the ultimate luxury--<i>time--</i>that would come with downsizing.<br /> <br /> Deciding to build an eighty-four-square-foot house--on her own, from the ground up--was just the beginning of building a new life. Williams can now list everything she owns on one sheet of paper, her monthly housekeeping bills amount to about eight dollars, and it takes her approximately ten minutes to clean the entire house. It's left her with more time to spend with family and friends, and given her freedom to head out for adventure at a moment's notice, or watch the clouds and sunset while drinking a beer on her (yes, tiny) front porch.<br /> <br /> The lessons Williams learned from her \"aha\" moment post-trauma apply to all of us, every day, regardless of whether or not we decide to discard all our worldly belongings. Part how-to, part personal memoir, <i>The Big Tiny</i> is an utterly seductive meditation on the benefits of slowing down, scaling back, and appreciating the truly important things in life.","isbn_10":"0399166173","isbn_13":"9780399166174","asin":"","page_count":304,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/3103/9780399166174_e8c5ca1b61e24e25ab7eadeb86ddd8e3.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:27.665130Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:27.665149Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/uIlqPSDu2B/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THaQoounz73P/the-big-tiny"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2017-01-22","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2017-01-22T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:27.684039Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:27.732513Z","user_review":{"id":"q5gO7y5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/q5gO7y5/","thoughts":"Nice memoir of someone who downsized her living to find what is essential in the end...

He is being menaced by a strange man in a flat cap - a wanted criminal who seems to have followed him all the way from America. In the days that follow, his home is robbed, his family is threatened. And then the first murder takes place.<br /> <br /> Almost unwillingly, Holmes and Watson find themselves being drawn ever deeper into an international conspiracy connected to the teeming criminal underworld of Boston, the gaslit streets of London, opium dens and much, much more. And as they dig, they begin to hear the whispered phrase-the House of Silk-a mysterious entity that connects the highest levels of government to the deepest depths of criminality. Holmes begins to fear that he has uncovered a conspiracy that threatens to tear apart the very fabric of society.<br /> <br /> The Arthur Conan Doyle Estate chose the celebrated, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Anthony Horowitz to write <i>The House of Silk</i> because of his proven ability to tell a transfixing story and for his passion for all things Holmes.

I'm going to share that mindset with you - along with hundreds of actionable techniques and proven habits - so you can shortcut those years. <p>Introducing <i>The Effective Engineer</i> - the only book designed specifically for today's software engineers, based on extensive interviews with engineering leaders at top tech companies, and packed with hundreds of techniques to accelerate your career. <p>For two years, I embarked on a quest seeking an answer to one question: <p><b>How do the most effective engineers make their efforts, their teams, and their careers more successful?</b> <p>I interviewed and collected stories from engineering VPs, directors, managers, and other leaders at today's top software companies: established, household names like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn; rapidly growing mid-sized companies like Dropbox, Square, Box, Airbnb, and Etsy; and startups like Reddit, Stripe, Instagram, and Lyft. <p>These leaders shared stories about the most valuable insights they've learned and the most common and costly mistakes that they've seen engineers - sometimes themselves - make. <p>This is just a small sampling of the hard questions I posed to them: <ul> <li>What engineering qualities correlate with future success? <li>What have you done that has paid off the highest returns? <li>What separates the most effective engineers you've worked with from everyone else? <li>What's the most valuable lesson your team has learned in the past year? <li>What advice do you give to new engineers on your team? </ul> <p>Everyone's story is different, but many of the lessons share common themes. <p>You'll get to hear stories like: <ul> <li>How did Instagram's team of 5 engineers build and support a service that grew to over 40 million users by the time the company was acquired? <li>How and why did Quora deploy code to production 40 to 50 times per day? <li>How did the team behind Google Docs become the fastest acquisition to rewrite its software to run on Google's infrastructure? <li>How does Etsy use continuous experimentation to design features that are <i>guaranteed</i> to increase revenue at launch? <li>How did Facebook's small infrastructure team effectively operate thousands of database servers? <li>How did Dropbox go from barely hiring any new engineers to nearly tripling its team size year-over-year? </ul> <p>What's more, I've distilled their stories into actionable habits and lessons that you can follow step-by-step to make your career and your team more successful. <p><b>The skills used by effective engineers are all learnable.</b> <p>And I'll teach them to you. With <i>The Effective Engineer</i>, I'll teach you a unifying framework called leverage - the value produced per unit of time invested - that you can use to identify the activities that produce disproportionate results. <p><b>Here's a sneak peek at some of the lessons you'll learn.</b> You'll learn how to: <ul> <li>Prioritize the right projects and tasks to increase your impact. <li>Earn more leeway from your peers and managers on your projects. <li>Spend less time <i>maintaining</i> and <i>fixing</i> software and more time <i>building</i> and <i>shipping</i> new features. <li>Produce more accurate software estimates. <li>Validate your ideas cheaply to reduce wasted work. <li>Navigate organizational and people-related bottlenecks. <li>Find the appropriate level of code reviews, testing, abstraction, and technical debt to balance speed and quality. <li>Shorten your debugging workflow to increase your iteration speed. <li>Use metrics to quantify your impact and consistently make progress. </ul>","isbn_10":"0996128107","isbn_13":"9780996128100","asin":"","page_count":260,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=1ShJrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72IKcDLj51gmv1UHi406Ys0olJHyF0eAxUAB4-YehUk50VKmknef-Cbub4hQr75Z7R1GdmfCtg_jsC8nSNIthjB4zXEYsaaZTFXgJdWY-_DYSEP12YuZg3q3fP4FEHdopQjbm3N&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-02-21T06:41:36.883789Z","updated_at":"2021-02-21T06:41:37.149928Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/pX54ctmYAf/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/1ShJrgEACAAJ/the-effective-engineer"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2016-09-30","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2016-09-30T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:30.761091Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:30.830202Z","user_review":{"id":"oNK6pM8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/oNK6pM8/","thoughts":"This is a great book full of good advices for every engineer","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"38rpbX5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/38rpbX5/","book":{"id":"ZNlY2m5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/ZNlY2m5/","share_identifier":"f3qopiGflY","slug":"harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THkgDcTmz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child","subtitle":"Parts One and Two Playscript","authors":["J.

And positive people are significantly healthier and less stressed and enjoy deeper social interaction than the less positive people around them.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Drawing on his original research--including one of the largest studies of happiness ever conducted--and work in boardrooms and classrooms across forty-two countries, Achor shows us how to rewire our brains for positivity and optimism to reap the happiness advantage in our lives, our careers, and even our health. His strategies include:<br /> &nbsp;<br /> * The Tetris Effect: how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility so we can see and seize opportunities all around us<br /> * Social Investment: how to earn the dividends of a strong social support network<br /> * The Ripple Effect: how to spread positive change within our teams, companies, and families<br /> &nbsp;<br /> By turns fascinating, hopeful, and timely, <i>The Happiness Advantage</i> reveals how small shifts in our mind-set and habits can produce big gains at work, at home, and elsewhere.","isbn_10":"0307591549","isbn_13":"9780307591548","asin":"","page_count":256,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/4907/9780307591548_d7248ae112da4a19930bb54ef0a61949.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.526141Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.526174Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/Qv9OiyIDTA/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THadskokz73P/the-happiness-advantage-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2016-01-10","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2016-01-10T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.543114Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.599812Z","user_review":{"id":"y5bdjg8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/y5bdjg8/","thoughts":"Reading this reminds you of simple common sense, applying it is another thing.<br/>I really like the remainders and the stories linked to each points.<br/><br/>Starting to read and meditate, this book resonates in me.<br/>You get the small advices on how to start tricking the brain and moving to a more positive energy.<br/><br/>I think this helps coming to a more meaningful life.<br/>Focusing on the important, your happiness helped by f","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"q8W3Pe8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/q8W3Pe8/","book":{"id":"x57R3ZN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/x57R3ZN/","share_identifier":"yinlJupoQm","slug":"killing-and-dying","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THn4H2n4z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Killing and Dying","subtitle":"","authors":["Adrian Tomine"],"publisher":"Drawn & Quarterly Publications","published_date":"2015-10-06","description":"<p><b>\"One of the most gifted graphic novelists of our time.\" --</b><i><b>Wired</b></i><br /> <br /> <br /> <i>Killing and Dying</i> is a stunning showcase of the possibilities of the graphic novel medium and a wry exploration of loss, creative ambition, identity, and family dynamics.

The Carter Family: Don't Forget This Song is a rich and compelling original graphic novel that tells the story of the Carter Family--the first superstar group of country music--who made hundreds of recordings and sold millions of records. Many of their hit songs, such as \"Wildwood Flower\" and \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken,\" have influenced countless musicians and remain timeless country standards. The Carter Family: Don't Forget This Song is not only a unique illustrated biography, but a moving account that reveals the family's rise to success, their struggles along the way, and their impact on contemporary music. Illustrated with exacting detail and written in the Southern dialect of the time, its dynamic narrative is pure Americana. It is also a story of success and failure, of poverty and wealth, of racism and tolerance, of creativity and business, and of the power of music and love. Includes bonus CD with original Carter Family music. Praise for The Carter Family: \"What a fine marriage of form and content! Humble and moving--straightforward with occasional breathtaking bravura passages--this book echoes the Carter Family's rough-hewn sounds. It tells of the lives, sorrows, and values of a lost America in short episodes like a giant stack of old 78s. Using the vocabulary of comic strips like Little Orphan Annie and Gasoline Alley, it's as obsessive in its dedication to vernacular craft and hard work as A.P. Carter himself. Frank Young and David Lasky have spun a work of visual music that will replay in your head and heart well after you've finished reading it.\"--Art Spiegelman, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer/artist of Maus \"Charming, faithful, and resonant . . . will charm the pants off you.\" --The Comics Journal \"Lasky's gorgeous artwork animates the story and evokes a mood that mirrors the era and the music.\" --NPR.org \"Pure pleasure for anyone interested in music history.\" --The Seattle Times \"Cracking open The Carter Family feels like putting on a vintage 78: moody hearty Americana emanates hauntingly. Enlivening this graphic biography of the legendary country music family are both Frank M. Young's dialogue, which replicates the vernacular to a T but oh so naturally, and David Lasky's understated and elegant illustrations which resonate like the music they depict.\" --HeebMagazine.com","isbn_10":"0810988364","isbn_13":"9780810988361","asin":"","page_count":192,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/2161/9780810988361_ba2c08c7a8564956bfb70d8c2463aef5.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.794335Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.794411Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/0bv32a7XVj/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THe4J8Ktz73P/the-carter-family"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2015-09-05","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2015-09-05T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.821534Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.869339Z","user_review":null,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"n82e2Zv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/n82e2Zv/","book":{"id":"PvzPq2N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/PvzPq2N/","share_identifier":"FMipZIct91","slug":"remote-pairing","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THoiPgyiz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Remote Pairing","subtitle":"Collaborative Tools for Distributed Development","authors":["Joe Kutner"],"publisher":"Pragmatic Programmers, LLC, The","published_date":"2013-12-17","description":"<p>You've heard about pair programming's benefits: fewer bugs, improved skills, and faster delivery. But what happens when you want to pair with someone in another city, country, or even hemisphere? With the right tools, you won't have to relocate to refactor. In this book, you'll learn techniques used by the most productive remote programmers in the industry to pair with anyone on the globe on any kind of project. You'll use collaborative editors, screen sharing, secure networking, and virtualization to create a remote pairing environment that feels as if your partner is sitting right next to you.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two heads are better than one, but only if they're working on the same problem. When pairing remotely, this requires a specialized environment that you'll learn how to create. We'll use the same open-source tools as the pros to improve collaboration and increase productivity. You'll learn techniques, patterns, and best practices you can apply to projects of all kinds. These tools are so effective that many co-located programmers use them despite sitting side-by-side--you don't have to work outside of an office for this book to improve your programming techniques.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We'll start by creating a secure collaborative editing environment capable of handling the low-bandwidth networks at some coffee shops. Then we'll share your screen using free open source tools and protocols. We'll deploy all of this to a server in the cloud so you can access your development environment from anywhere. Then we'll use one of the most advanced integrated development environments to collaborate, sketch on a virtual whiteboard, and resolve conflicts.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, we'll talk with programmers at Pivotal Labs, Big Nerd Ranch, and other top-notch distributed development firms to learn how they handle the challenges of remote pairing on a daily basis. With their help and advice, you can be productive from any location on the planet.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>What You Need:</b>Many of the examples in this book require an internet connection. You'll only need one computer for most of the exercises, and you can run them by yourself. But havinga second computer and even a second person may improve the experience.</p>","isbn_10":"1937785742","isbn_13":"9781937785741","asin":"","page_count":108,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/3814/9781937785741_ae7fc53894a4409786eded021e198e47.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.685490Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.685514Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/FMipZIct91/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THoiPgyiz73P/remote-pairing"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2015-08-15","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2015-08-15T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.710348Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.772913Z","user_review":{"id":"PvzKj28","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/PvzKj28/","thoughts":"Good overview of technical side of remote pairing","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"6vLbPyN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/6vLbPyN/","book":{"id":"38GyeX5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/38GyeX5/","share_identifier":"kNq2u41UrV","slug":"understanding-comics-1","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THm1QLi5z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Understanding Comics","subtitle":"The Invisible Art","authors":["Scott McCloud"],"publisher":"Perfection Learning Corporation","published_date":"1994-05-17","description":"Praised throughout the cartoon industry by such luminaries as Art Spiegelman, Matt Groening, and Will Eisner, this innovative comic book provides a detailed look at the history, meaning, and art of comics and cartooning.","isbn_10":"1627652736","isbn_13":"9781627652735","asin":"","page_count":null,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/55/9781627652735_ae798faf75134e8cb4cfad8928325219.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T17:22:15.597196Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T17:22:15.597221Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/kNq2u41UrV/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THm1QLi5z73P/understanding-comics-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2015-07-06","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2015-07-06T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.350208Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.427653Z","user_review":null,"percent_complete":null},{"id":"g5R9P4N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/g5R9P4N/","book":{"id":"q5gX7yv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/q5gX7yv/","share_identifier":"owtV0mh7R1","slug":"meanwhile-in-san-francisco","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THjA05Jqz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Meanwhile, in San Francisco","subtitle":"The City in Its Own Words","authors":["Wendy MacNaughton"],"publisher":"Chronicle Books LLC","published_date":"2014-03-18","description":"Take a stroll through the City by the Bay with renowned artist Wendy MacNaughton in this illustrated collection of everyday observations.

In his agonized search for absolute truth, Russell crosses paths with legendary thinkers like Gottlob Frege, David Hilbert, and Kurt Gödel, and finds a passionate student in the great Ludwig Wittgenstein. But his most ambitious goal—to establish unshakable logical foundations of mathematics—continues to loom before him. Through love and hate, peace and war, Russell persists in the dogged mission that threatens to claim both his career and his personal happiness, finally driving him to the brink of insanity. <p></p>This story is at the same time a historical novel and an accessible explication of some of the biggest ideas of mathematics and modern philosophy. With rich characterizations and expressive, atmospheric artwork, the book spins the pursuit of these ideas into a highly satisfying tale.  Probing and ingeniously layered, the book throws light on Russell’s inner struggles while setting them in the context of the timeless questions he spent his life trying to answer. At its heart, <i>Logicomix </i>is a story about the conflict between an ideal rationality and the unchanging, flawed fabric of reality.","isbn_10":"1596914521","isbn_13":"9781596914520","asin":"","page_count":347,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kt1IngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72F3-B66ySvLE92hMkBOjFXcL7JfoVSUc7b6C5aeMLE63RwsHyJOS137l5E9Ow2mlRh91_0kjmILE8ipZtmj_dqTVODZBONGpdivJuWDYI6v2YFQWdRl6AW0BtHVA7oW__YQyEI&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-01-18T15:39:15.804156Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T15:39:16.139835Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/cetfsmLaYm/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/Kt1IngEACAAJ/logicomix"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2015-06-04","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2015-06-04T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.218011Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.300289Z","user_review":null,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"Y8d0QZ8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/Y8d0QZ8/","book":{"id":"ZNBZRWN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/ZNBZRWN/","share_identifier":"sioyngaf78","slug":"manage-your-day-to-day","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THjLp5cqz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Manage Your Day-To-Day","subtitle":"Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus, and Sharpen Your Creative Mind","authors":["Scott Belsky (Foreword by)","Jocelyn K.

The result of thorough research, keen insight, and unassailable common sense, \"Good Calories, Bad Calories\" immediately stirred controversy and acclaim among academics, journalists, and writers alike. Michael Pollan heralded it as \"a vitally important book, destined to change the way we think about food.\" <BR>Building upon this critical work in \"Good Calories, Bad Calories\" and presenting fresh evidence for his claim, Taubes now revisits the urgent question of what's making us fat--and how we can change--in this exciting new book. Persuasive, straightforward, and practical, \"Why We Get Fat \"makes Taubes's crucial argument newly accessible to a wider audience. <BR>Taubes reveals the bad nutritional science of the last century, none more damaging or misguided than the \"calories-in, calories-out\" model of why we get fat, and the good science that has been ignored, especially regarding insulin's regulation of our fat tissue. He also answers the most persistent questions: Why are some people thin and others fat? What roles do exercise and genetics play in our weight? What foods should we eat, and what foods should we avoid? <BR>Packed with essential information and concluding with an easy-to-follow diet, \"Why We Get Fat \"is an invaluable key in our understanding of an international epidemic and a guide to what each of us can do about it. <P>\"From the Hardcover edition.\"","isbn_10":"1299154212","isbn_13":"9781299154216","asin":"","page_count":null,"binding":"E-Book","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/2447/9781299154216_6b704f0465a2495289d028283e2e0212.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:37.336313Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:37.336333Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/wEEgJv2W29/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THipfrkQz73P/why-we-get-fat"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2015-05-07","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2015-05-07T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:37.355440Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:37.404172Z","user_review":{"id":"Vv1bQA8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/Vv1bQA8/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":null},{"id":"QNAVP05","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/QNAVP05/","book":{"id":"gNqmpdN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/gNqmpdN/","share_identifier":"jSjH736CSR","slug":"the-healthy-programmer","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THoiPgnPz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Healthy Programmer","subtitle":"Get Fit, Feel Better, and Keep Coding","authors":["Joe Kutner"],"publisher":"Pragmatic Programmers, LLC, The","published_date":"2013-07-09","description":"<p><b>Printed in full color.</b><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To keep doing what you love, you need to maintain your own systems, not just the ones you write code for.

Tom DeMarco, a leading management consultant to both Fortune 500 and up-and-coming companies, reveals a counterintuitive principle that explains why efficiency efforts can slow a company down. That principle is the value of slack, the degree of freedom in a company that allows it to change. Implementing slack could be as simple as adding an assistant to a department and letting high-priced talent spend less time at the photocopier and more time making key decisions, or it could mean designing workloads that allow people room to think, innovate, and reinvent themselves. It means embracing risk, eliminating fear, and knowing when to go slow. Slack allows for change, fosters creativity, promotes quality, and, above all, produces growth.<br /> <br /> With an approach that works for new- and old-economy companies alike, this revolutionary handbook debunks commonly held assumptions about real-world management, and gives you and your company a brand-new model for achieving and maintaining true effectiveness.","isbn_10":"0767907698","isbn_13":"9780767907699","asin":"","page_count":256,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/5976/9780767907699_007d8354f6394133942d48cd87acbfce.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T17:33:59.734951Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T17:33:59.734975Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/bPRjTxkami/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/0/1THdBxDTbz73P/slack"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2014-05-22","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2014-05-22T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:39.404809Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:39.466123Z","user_review":{"id":"gNqzlA5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/gNqzlA5/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"q5g0Lav","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/q5g0Lav/","book":{"id":"BN92P95","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/BN92P95/","share_identifier":"hSKSB406uz","slug":"une-creativite-sans-limite","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THkm5ry8z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Une Créativité Sans Limite !","subtitle":"N'ayez Plus de Manque D'idées","authors":["Raphaël Lejoly"],"publisher":"Independently Published","published_date":"2017-09-05","description":"Vous avez déjà ressenti un manque d'idées, une perte d'idées ou la situation de la page blanche?Découvrez à travers ce livre une multitude de conseils afin de perfectionner votre créativité.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. <i>World War Z</i> is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.<br><br>Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. <br><br>Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, “By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?”<br><br>Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.<br><br><br>Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war<br><br>“I found 'Patient Zero' behind the locked door of an abandoned apartment across town. . . . His wrists and feet were bound with plastic packing twine. Although he'd rubbed off the skin around his bonds, there was no blood. There was also no blood on his other wounds. . . . He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls. At first the villagers tried to hold me back. They warned me not to touch him, that he was 'cursed.' I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy's skin was . . . cold and gray . . . I could find neither his heartbeat nor his pulse.” —Dr. Kwang Jingshu, Greater Chongqing, United Federation of China<br><br><br>“'Shock and Awe'? Perfect name. . . . But what if the enemy can't be shocked and awed? Not just won't, but biologically can't! That's what happened that day outside New York City, that's the failure that almost lost us the whole damn war. The fact that we couldn't shock and awe Zack boomeranged right back in our faces and actually allowed Zack to shock and awe us! They're not afraid! No matter what we do, no matter how many we kill, they will never, ever be afraid!” —Todd Wainio, former U.S. Army infantryman and veteran of the Battle of Yonkers<br><br><br>“Two hundred million zombies. Who can even visualize that type of number, let alone combat it? . . . For the first time in history, we faced an enemy that was actively waging total war. They had no limits of endurance. They would never negotiate, never surrender. They would fight until the very end because, unlike us, every single one of them, every second of every day, was devoted to consuming all life on Earth.” —General Travis D'Ambrosia, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe","isbn_10":"0307346609","isbn_13":"9780307346605","asin":"","page_count":354,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=oj2FDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71RIqlFRBEkuzHCyoqo-uv6nfxT_DfXElwAEsGn_L2MJK5CEIjV7Y4TXc7T4YUWdhJSwBgfR8hauBAlKq1LhDTGd9E_T0Wog9KCPXhIqfE_g-jrkKn-2vl7cMSciTZ2BaCzC-59&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-01-14T22:12:20.535174Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T22:12:20.752211Z","add_book_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/actions/book/KX9yqpNq8I/","book_detail_url":"https://www.italictype.com/app/#/books/1/oj2FDwAAQBAJ/world-war-z"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2010-01-19","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2010-01-19T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:40.616036Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:40.671738Z","user_review":{"id":"E5JO4Yv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/E5JO4Yv/","thoughts":"This book is a really good docu fiction about what would happens to earth if there is a zombie infection!<br/><br/>There are really good shorts stories about how it started and how they fought it!<br/><br/>The whole book is just about facts from people who lived that war!<br/>","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"percent_complete":0},{"id":"K8Oo7j8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/K8Oo7j8/","book":{"id":"n84Q3KN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/n84Q3KN/","share_identifier":"68ZbUmaq16","slug":"ordinary-victories","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THkqjJ30z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Ordinary Victories","subtitle":"","authors":["Manu Larcenet (Illustrator)"],"publisher":"NBM Publishing Company","published_date":"2005-05-01","description":"This is the story of Marc, a photographer who's tired, of a very patient chick he meets, of banal horrors and of his pain-in-the-neck cat.
