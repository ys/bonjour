He begged God to heal her, but she died anyway. When they buried her body, Tyson also buried the childhood version of his faith.<br>  <br> Shortly before her death, however, Tyson became intrigued by the complicated legacy of Father Junipero Serra, the 18th-century Franciscan monk and canonized saint who dedicated his life to the idea that tragedy and suffering are portals to renewal. Father Serra built Missions up and down the California coast, spreading Christianity, as well as enabling and aiding in the oppression and colonization of the native Californians. Tyson discovered Serra’s “El Camino Real,” a 600-mile pilgrimage route up the California coast that had been largely forgotten for more than 200 years.<br><br> Two days after they buried his mother, Tyson set out on a pilgrimage of sorts, intending to walk from San Diego to San Francisco along the El Camino, following in the footsteps of the saint.  Tyson’s journey takes him down smog-choked highways, across fog-laden beaches, past multi-million-dollar coastal estates, and along the towering cliffs of Big Sur. And as he walks, Tyson also wrestles with his faith, questioning the pat answers and easy prayers he once readily accepted, trying to understand how hope and tragedy can all be wrapped up in the same God. The people he meets along the way challenge his understanding of the meaning of security, of what it means to live a meaningful life, and of the legacies we all leave behind.<br>  <br><i>Where the Waves Turn Back</i> is both part journal and part spiritual memoir, and ultimately, a thrilling and deeply satisfying read that asks questions that will resonate with readers seeking meaning in an utterly disorienting age.","isbn_10":"1546003460","isbn_13":"9781546003465","asin":"","page_count":245,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=8FaAEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73y_6D7_EhuH00bnFhOBx5HcsaumyaJF9ETM_QS2ooShiJyqWmDUKrVmIxpctkoyY3JMr9wH1hDWDG8Iw-Y-IUbhf-otLancJyynAkApVh04nTkc_-3U5Rd3g9YIJ28zg6ifP6a&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2023-09-16T16:11:49.653117Z","updated_at":"2023-09-16T16:11:49.964902Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/tpOKOpvtmO/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/8FaAEAAAQBAJ/where-the-waves-turn-back"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2023-09-16T16:11:56.325513Z","finished_reading_at":"2023-09-26T07:01:30.319445Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2023-09-16T16:11:49.663475Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T07:01:30.319602Z","user_review":{"id":"NmmxWdN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/NmmxWdN/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":["Page-turner","Inspiring"]},"page_count":245,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"NKDrRG5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/NKDrRG5/","book":{"id":"NBrYo2N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/NBrYo2N/","share_identifier":"3rX6vMtaA2","slug":"ebb-and-flow-1","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"219UEAAAQBAJ","source_etag":"wCcDtRwHplM","title":"Ebb and Flow","subtitle":"How to Connect with the Patterns and Power of Water","authors":["Easkey Britton"],"publisher":"Watkins Media Limited","published_date":"2023-04-11","description":"<b>An exploration of water's power to heal us, inspire us and offer us spiritual meaning.

It’s about how we can restore our relationship with the world's different bodies of water, and by doing so, restore both the water and ourselves.

These range from simple breathing and visualization exercises to undertaking a journey from a water source to the ocean in order to forge a deep connection with the water. The emphasis is as much on the benefit to water as it is to the individual, and on creating a culture of reciprocity and care. By regaining this lost connection with water, we learn to develop an empathic connection with the force of all life and in the process restore our own hearts and minds.","isbn_10":"1786786680","isbn_13":"9781786786685","asin":"","page_count":214,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=219UEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71pskFpD0JvZT8mjYo-Fjsb3rIiLm0cs1zzSXvi8L7tsemYWUGDZixiFXMQx7f3_Wyo_HafpP_Mu-_TIgyXaKEWC4sKpGzIJyIeflB-6uNJxXpcrUj8cnZDS60pRCb53wQiDyP3&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2023-09-19T21:58:33.129933Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T21:58:33.429831Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/3rX6vMtaA2/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/219UEAAAQBAJ/ebb-and-flow-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2023-09-19T21:58:39.075959Z","finished_reading_at":"2023-09-19T21:58:49.662707Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2023-09-19T21:58:33.143138Z","updated_at":"2023-09-19T21:58:49.662874Z","user_review":{"id":"NmmxQwN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/NmmxQwN/","thoughts":"","rating":"3.5","review_tags":["Enriching"]},"page_count":214,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"NpzM4gv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/NpzM4gv/","book":{"id":"8ede3Yv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/8ede3Yv/","share_identifier":"Ic5tjQ6HVN","slug":"last-exit-to-brooklyn-3","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"kK2GyMp3ymYC","source_etag":"OOjBPGfHBB0","title":"Last Exit to Brooklyn","subtitle":"","authors":["Hubert Selby"],"publisher":"Grove Press","published_date":"1988","description":"<i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i> remains undiminished in its awesome power and magnitude as the novel that first showed us the fierce, primal rage seething in America's cities.

Tes amis te le demandaient souvent : pourquoi encore cette ville? Pourquoi tout ce temps? Qu'y a-t-il à New York que tu ne connais pas déjà? Parfois tu te le demandais aussi. Tu l'avais arpentée en long, en large et en travers, si bien que tu la connaissais mieux que ta ville natale. \"Pour écrire\" était la réponse qui coupait court à toute question. Mais il y avait quelque chose d'autre de trop difficile à expliquer. \"En 2003, Paolo Cognetti, âgé de 25 ans, se rend à New York pour réaliser une série de films documentaires sur la littérature américaine. Le jeune écrivain tombe sous le charme de la ville qui ne dort jamais et, pendant dix ans, il n'aura de cesse d'y retourner. Ces Carnets de New York sont le récit de ses multiples allers-retours dans la ville \"des chasseurs de fortune, des souffleurs de bulles de savon et des rêves brisés\". Dans cette langue qui n'appartient qu'à lui - divin mélange de simplicité et de poésie -, il nous entraîne sur les pas de ses héros littéraires, Melville, Whitman, Ginsberg, Capote ou encore Paley, Salinger et Kerouac. Il déambule dans Brooklyn, \"la ville des écrivains\", erre entre les gratte-ciel de Manhattan, traîne sa solitude le long de l'Hudson ou de l'East River, fait une pause chez Ozzie's pour noircir les pages de son carnet. Comme toujours avec Paolo Cognetti, il n'est de voyage sans rencontres et nouvelles amitiés : à chaque retour à New York, le voilà qui retrouve ses amis italo-américains, Bob, son \"oncle de Brooklyn\" qui doit ses rudiments d'italien à lecture de Moravia et Jimmy, qui nourrit une passion pour Mussolini et n'a jamais mis les pieds en Italie. Illustré de neuf cartes dessinées par l'auteur, ces carnets sont une ode à New York, \"ses ponts, ses îles, ses automnes, ses habitants mi-réels, mi-fantastiques\".\"--Résumé de l'éditeur","isbn_10":"2234086329","isbn_13":"9782234086326","asin":"","page_count":203,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://www.italictype.com/static/images/bookcover-not-found.png","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2023-05-09T20:52:20.431114Z","updated_at":"2023-05-09T20:52:20.762927Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/c6vbGkeQWE/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/24X8zQEACAAJ/carnets-de-new-york"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2023-05-09T20:52:31.191443Z","finished_reading_at":"2023-05-09T20:52:42.478550Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2023-05-09T20:52:20.442787Z","updated_at":"2023-05-09T20:52:42.478698Z","user_review":{"id":"vEL0jG5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/vEL0jG5/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":["Page-turner","Inspiring","Beautiful writing"]},"page_count":203,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"5kla4av","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/5kla4av/","book":{"id":"8rjjoB8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/8rjjoB8/","share_identifier":"ss4xhVWAwv","slug":"lhomme-qui-marche","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"d2oWrgEACAAJ","source_etag":"eRQamYvv+3I","title":"L'homme qui marche","subtitle":"","authors":["Jirō Taniguchi"],"publisher":"Casterman","published_date":"2015","description":"À l'heure où d'autres se laissent accaparer par les obligations et les tracasseries quotidiennes, happer par la course toujours plus effrénée des jours qui défilent, lui sait prendre le temps.

In the early 1990s, just prior to his immersion in the scene around New York's Alleged Gallery, Campbell would regularly hole up in the North African enclave to produce paintings for solo exhibitions in Paris, New York and Rabat, all the while scouring the coast during the winter months for whatever waves might roll in from the Atlantic. Later, over the last ten years, Campbell brought various surfers of note (such as Dan Malloy, Alex Knost, Craig Anderson, Dave Rastovich and Ryan Burch) to join him there, and to savor Morocco's glorious climate and stupendous surf. This book, the second in Campbell's <i>Slide</i> surfing series (following 2012's <i>Slide Your Brains Out</i>), records these collective Moroccan adventures from the past 20 years, in color and black-and-white images that range from the everyday to the sublime.","isbn_10":"0985361131","isbn_13":"9780985361136","asin":"","page_count":144,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=IYS5oAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71fyQcz8aKp5KIcck0Vq8qNbuCWar7Lx1tiAVAB49qQqxCGWep8XpF0Sdyv3TmW5kECkeJZ3J1xDDFSvmr0V1e46iedhgCj5Cx5v-y2KgMG69mT82NL0J6B1aAaVAGDsgPYnAFs&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2023-03-20T20:13:30.819015Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T20:13:31.099125Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/ELrjns2dgN/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/IYS5oAEACAAJ/seeing-fatimas-eyes"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2023-03-20T20:13:35.358725Z","finished_reading_at":"2023-03-20T20:13:44.301718Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2023-03-20T20:13:30.826989Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T20:13:44.301881Z","user_review":{"id":"5DnAyQ8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/5DnAyQ8/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.5","review_tags":[]},"page_count":144,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"5JY9a0N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/5JY9a0N/","book":{"id":"8WWwLL8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/8WWwLL8/","share_identifier":"3AkE7B8gTB","slug":"jours-barbares","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"sktIDgAAQBAJ","source_etag":"E5a4eFcjlrw","title":"Jours barbares","subtitle":"","authors":["William Finnegan"],"publisher":"Editions du Sous-Sol","published_date":"2017-03-16","description":"<p>Le surf ressemble à <i>Un sport, un passe-temps</i>. Pour ses initiés, c'est bien plus : une addiction merveilleuse, une initiation exigeante, un art de vivre. Elevé en Californie et à Hawaï, William Finnegan a commencé le surf enfant. Après l'université, il a traqué les vagues aux quatre coins du monde, errant des îles Fidji à l'Indonésie, des plages bondées de Los Angeles aux déserts australiens, des townships de Johannesburg aux falaises de l'île de Madère. D'un gamin aventureux, passionné de littérature, il devint un écrivain, un reporter de guerre pour le <i>New Yorker</i>. À travers ses mémoires, il dépeint une vie à contre-courant, à la recherche d'une autre voie, au-delà des canons de la réussite, de l'argent et du carriérisme ; et avec une infinie pudeur se dessine le portrait d'un homme qui aura trouvé dans son rapport à l'océan une échappatoire au monde et une source constante d'émerveillement. Ode à l'enfance, à l'amitié et à la famille, <i>Jours Barbares</i> formule une éthique de vie, entre le paradis et l'enfer des vagues, où l'océan apparaît toujours comme un purgatoire. Un livre rare dont on ne ressort pas tout à fait indemne, entre<i> Hell's Angels</i> de Hunter S. Thompson et<i> Into The Wild</i> de Jon Krakauer.<br><br> William Finnegan a acquis ses galons de journaliste lors de la guerre civile au Soudan, en Afrique du Sud pendant l'Apartheid, dans les Balkans ou à Mogadiscio. Ses reportages sur les théâtres d'opérations sont le fruit de longues immersions et de patientes observations, ou, comme il aime à le résumer : \"Je fouine, je parle aux gens, j'attends.' Il a reçu en 2016 pour <i>Jours Barbares</i> le prestigieux Prix Pulitzer.<br><br></p>","isbn_10":"2364681820","isbn_13":"9782364681828","asin":"","page_count":429,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=sktIDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72ddgRWj3K28rp_7r5RYSV9ne7_SdqTnaF7KZVh9jUhc6oza6PP6yCeoGjrvpN-vIDoYhzKplshR66PM_gEdjykhrTlklyEfL0QuAn1oDNg373XLaAnxoQ94Ub8rvnDFV9cWTmM&source=gbs_api","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2023-03-13T20:33:59.880297Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T20:34:00.356683Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/3AkE7B8gTB/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/sktIDgAAQBAJ/jours-barbares"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2023-03-13T20:34:04.462822Z","finished_reading_at":"2023-03-13T20:34:22.486289Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2023-03-13T20:33:59.889012Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T20:34:22.486500Z","user_review":{"id":"Nq4xDL8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/Nq4xDL8/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":["Inspiring","Enriching","Beautiful writing","Fantastic"]},"page_count":429,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"8OrmYwv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/8OrmYwv/","book":{"id":"5ybyblv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/5ybyblv/","share_identifier":"7ykmwgvniu","slug":"la-vie-de-bouddha","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"vgAJvgEACAAJ","source_etag":"eaFnwlG6B5M","title":"La vie de Bouddha","subtitle":"intégrale","authors":["Osamu Tezuka"],"publisher":"Delcourt-Tonkam","published_date":"2018","description":"\"Du prolifique auteur qui étudia la médecine avant de se consacrer à la bande dessinée japonaise et qui est considéré comme le père spirituel des créateurs de mangas, cette série propose une biographie librement adaptée de Shakyamuni, reconnu comme étant le Bouddha originel.

Les onze textes ici réunis (restés à ce jour inédits en France et parés d’une aura quasi mythique aux Etats-Unis) nous entraînent dans une plongée en immersion au cœur du quartier hippie de San Francisco en 1967 ; à la rencontre de John Wayne, des Doors ou des Black Panthers ; dans les collines de Los Angeles terrorisées par la « famille » Manson ; à New York en proie à l’hystérie collective au lendemain d’un meurtre à Central Park ; sur la plage hawaïenne de Tant qu’il y aura des hommes ; ou encore dans les méandres des fêlures mentales de Joan Didion elle-même, qui par la force ensorcelante de son écriture ne cesse de surprendre, de déranger, et d’émouvoir.","isbn_10":"224680471X","isbn_13":"9782246804710","asin":"","page_count":201,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=EqdYEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71REJZY--mkeeNQIMmsC6cqDlvkeH5ax5ayTMlMTjylkDuSeatMsOP41dQ5AyQCkpjtlB4HPj3TPTz9xCd-DR5NM4hyG1Cn5xpq70fKYPc_2-tCVdGpUz_TNagnkwm6QEr_2dXd&source=gbs_api","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2022-11-29T22:20:10.743449Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T22:20:11.065345Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/ej5bSo8aCx/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/EqdYEAAAQBAJ/lamerique"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2022-11-29T22:20:14.874612Z","finished_reading_at":"2022-12-15T22:26:45.496363Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2022-11-29T22:20:10.754447Z","updated_at":"2022-12-15T22:26:45.503927Z","user_review":{"id":"82VlrZ8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/82VlrZ8/","thoughts":"","rating":"3.5","review_tags":["Inspiring"]},"page_count":201,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"8oPRKrN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/8oPRKrN/","book":{"id":"vx4Y1av","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/vx4Y1av/","share_identifier":"dR3vIuIoDk","slug":"lannee-de-la-pensee-magique","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"9asoDwAAQBAJ","source_etag":"gRfp8rCUA20","title":"L'année de la pensée magique","subtitle":"","authors":["Joan Didion"],"publisher":"Grasset","published_date":"2007-09-05","description":"Une soirée ordinaire, fin décembre à New York. Joan Didion s'apprête à dîner avec son mari, l'écrivain John Gregory Dunne - quand ce dernier s’écroule sur la table de la salle à manger, victime d'une crise cardiaque foudroyante. Pendant une année entière, Didion essaiera de se résoudre à la mort du compagnon de toute sa vie, tout en s'occupant de leur fille, plongée dans le coma suite à une grave pneumonie. La souffrance, l'incompréhension, l'incrédulité, la méditation obsessionnelle autour de cet événement si commun et pourtant inconcevable : dans un récit impressionnant de sobriété et d'implacable honnêteté, Didion raconte la folie du deuil et dissèque, entre sécheresse clinique et monologue intérieur, la plus indicible expérience - et sa rédemption par la littérature. « Quintessence du style, son écriture est la fusion du feu et de la glace. Laconique, tenue, sèche, cruelle et lyrique à la fois. (...) Disons que ce serait la version féminine de Samuel Beckett, en lunettes noires, qui siroterait un cocktail au bord d’une piscine californienne. Disons que s’il y avait des “premières dames” de la littérature américaine, Joan Didion serait sa Jackie Kennedy. » (Myriam Anderson, Le Figaro Magazine, 9 septembre 2006)","isbn_10":"2246804922","isbn_13":"9782246804925","asin":"","page_count":101,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=9asoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE708b_SXF54ksBoraIJiil8iXYOS9pfTy3qME7hM6QZNewEZK6_ApZwpEYrPWhR-oiVhK0GcY3mZm9JzcM2tEyn_RIDvhus_jV2FZPbcWNHkmhVPzJFnFayQuDujUUB4wD8KmdtP&source=gbs_api","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2022-11-29T15:46:30.431074Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T15:46:30.652530Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/dR3vIuIoDk/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/9asoDwAAQBAJ/lannee-de-la-pensee-magique"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2022-11-29T15:46:30.436185Z","finished_reading_at":"2022-11-29T15:46:39.657727Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2022-11-29T15:46:30.438936Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T15:46:39.657884Z","user_review":{"id":"5JMpDBN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/5JMpDBN/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":101,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"5XOKVLN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/5XOKVLN/","book":{"id":"8dYD0EN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/8dYD0EN/","share_identifier":"r4BZXDICq4","slug":"waves-and-beaches-1","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"4G1syAEACAAJ","source_etag":"vD4pF1EBLHc","title":"Waves and Beaches","subtitle":"The Powerful Dynamics of Sea and Coast","authors":["Kim McCoy","Willard Bascom"],"publisher":"Patagonia","published_date":"2021-03","description":"<p><b>The Bestselling Classic Updated for Surfers, Sailors, Oceanographers, Climate Activists, and Those Who Love the Sea</b></p> <p>First published in 1963 and updated in 1979, this classic was an essential handbook for anyone who studies, surfs, protects, or is fascinated by the ocean.

Mais l’idéalisme de l’un et le scepticisme de l’autre auront des conséquences déchirantes. </p> <p>Couronné en 2017 par le prix Pulitzer pour <i>Underdground Railroad</i> puis en 2020 pour <i>Nickel Boys</i>, Colson Whitehead s’inscrit dans la lignée des rares romanciers distingués à deux reprises par cette prestigieuse récompense, à l’instar de William Faulkner et John Updike. S’inspirant de faits réels, il continue d’explorer l’inguérissable blessure raciale de l’Amérique et donne avec ce nouveau roman saisissant une sépulture littéraire à des centaines d’innocents, victimes de l’injustice du fait de leur couleur de peau.</p> <p> « Le roman de Colson Whitehead est une lecture nécessaire. Il détaille la façon dont les lois raciales ont anéanti des existences et montre que leurs effets se font sentir encore aujourd’hui. » <i>Barack Obama</i><b> </p></b>","isbn_10":"2226449787","isbn_13":"9782226449788","asin":"","page_count":193,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=2rK8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71hr2njudbRR-edtzZ6jei6I0iD7fbOzzezDINbKoX5wcufm_pyMcoiaQQRefNz74yDKXlagmM5q8yvYATnap-LDN4NlHLPlz1LmiqzlrYQf8hHBqkr-RCffLjdOLK_Rx6WeTb6&source=gbs_api","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2022-01-19T20:28:18.944364Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T20:28:19.193048Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/1FjuBzR9E5/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/2rK8DwAAQBAJ/nickel-boys-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2022-01-19T20:28:36.654874Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2022-01-19T20:28:18.953144Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T20:28:36.655018Z","user_review":{"id":"6vLL6mv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/6vLL6mv/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":["Page-turner","Teary eyed"]},"page_count":193,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"vzbbwRv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/vzbbwRv/","book":{"id":"6vLB1aN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/6vLB1aN/","share_identifier":"KIaLc8jKi3","slug":"tant-que-le-cafe-est-encore-chaud","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"DNw_EAAAQBAJ","source_etag":"Yn69WqbdbHk","title":"Tant que le café est encore chaud","subtitle":"","authors":["Toshikazu Kawaguchi"],"publisher":"ALBIN MICHEL","published_date":"2021-10-01","description":"<p>Chez Funiculi Funicula, le café change le cœur des hommes.</p> <p>A Tokyo se trouve un petit établissement au sujet duquel circulent mille légendes.

Easkey Britton provides a rare female perspective on surfing, exploring the mental skills it fosters, and the need to recognize the value of the ocean and of nature's cycles in our lives.</b><br> <br> This is an incredibly inspiring exploration of the sea's role in the wellness of people and the planet, beautifully written by Easkey Britton - surfer, scientist and social activist. She offers a powerful female perspective on the sea and surfing, explaining what it's like to be a woman in a man's world and how she promoted the sport to women in Iran, surfing while wearing a hijab. She speaks of the undiscussed taboo around entering the water while menstruating - and of how she has come to celebrate her own bodily cycles. She has developed her own approach to surfing, which instead of seeking to dominate the waves, works in tune with the natural cycles of her body, the moon and the seasons. In a society that rewards busyness, she believes that understanding the influence of cycles becomes even more important - and we all have them, men and women. <br> <br> For Easkey, the sea is a source of mental and physical wellbeing. She explores the mental toughness needed in big-wave surfing, and presents surfing as an embodied mindfulness practice in which we can find flow and connect with the movement of the waves. She stresses the need to recognize the ocean as our most powerful ally when addressing our greatest global challenge: the climate crisis. Above all, Easkey's relationship to the sea has taught her about the need to meet life and evolve with it, rather than seeking to control it. By such wisdom our planet might just survive and thrive.","isbn_10":"1786785552","isbn_13":"9781786785558","asin":"","page_count":256,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=B7YhzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71pTdzu3ab_fhtHgM-xN4BcMN-702dBc0ApNa_EKy6VhtvYr_3jnisw-amdnm_sy8u0mhT6XNxYe5EpOOusSD6cs4HUpk73j-usZfV9xm7YacJO_NDUfISua5AHgjJlv8lo4hIY&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-06-21T11:52:53.638151Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T11:52:53.905563Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/BWxJ0L9PSr/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/B7YhzgEACAAJ/saltwater-in-the-blood"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":12,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2021-12-19T13:06:09.653338Z","finished_reading_at":"2021-12-26T10:22:05.057328Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-06-21T11:52:53.644054Z","updated_at":"2021-12-26T10:22:05.057528Z","user_review":{"id":"QNAD348","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/QNAD348/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":["Inspiring","Enriching"]},"page_count":256,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"vz1xlY5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/vz1xlY5/","book":{"id":"A5DPpE5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/A5DPpE5/","share_identifier":"4VyVJe2H2e","slug":"la-felicite-du-loup","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"EAM1EAAAQBAJ","source_etag":"q+DBBg9GWik","title":"La félicité du loup","subtitle":"","authors":["Paolo Cognetti"],"publisher":"Stock","published_date":"2021-09-01","description":"Fausto a quarante ans, Silvia en a vingt-sept.

Fausto fait office de cuisinier, Silvia, de serveuse. Ils se rapprochent doucement, s’abandonnant petit à petit au corps de l’autre, sans rien se promettre pour autant. Alors qu’arrive le printemps et que la neige commence à fondre, Silvia quitte Fontana Fredda pour aller toujours plus haut, vers le glacier Felik, tandis que Fausto doit redescendre en ville rassembler les morceaux de sa vie antérieure et finaliser son divorce.

C’est l’été sur l’Île aux moutons. Jeanne dîne au Restaurant du Port avec son père et sa grand-mère. La petite fille s’ennuie et quitte la table pour aller jouer à la marelle, sur le quai. Au même moment, un homard observe les allées et venues des serveurs. Contrairement à ses camarades d’infortune, il comprend très vite qu’il est condamné à une mort certaine. Lorsqu’un cuisinier le plonge dans une casserole d’eau bouillante, il prend la fuite. À moitié cuit mais bien décidé à retrouver les abysses de son enfance, il croise la route de Jeanne... Cette nouvelle aventure aborde avec sensibilité et tout en délicatesse la question de la souffrance animale. Auteur : Thomas Gerbeaux est né à Paris dans une famille bretonne. Il a publié de nombreux articles et écrit régulièrement pour la publicité.

De la découverte des îles du Pacifique par le capitaine Cook à l'annexion de l'archipel par les Etats-Unis, les obstacles à son ascension furent nombreux et souvent dramatiques : guerres fratricides, épidémies mortelles et missionnaires brutaux ont bien failli faire sombrer l'art de la glisse dans l'oubli, en même temps que la culture hawaïenne. Jérémy Lemarié retrace de manière inédite cette aventure extraordinaire, qui commence avec l'arrivée des premiers Polynésiens sur l'archipel et la naissance des premiers royaumes. Vous découvrirez que notre amour pour l'océan, le culte du corps, les rituels de baignade et l'art de chevaucher les déferlantes sont autant d'héritages issus de la culture insulaire. De Mark Twain à Jack London en passant par le Capitaine Cook et Duke Kahanamoku, jusqu'aux plages de Biarritz : une philosophie est née, avec ses légendes, ses héros, ses révolutions, et surtout, sa recherche éperdue de liberté.

C’est pendant, et à la suite de ce séjour, qu’elle écrit ce récit. Là, sous le grand phare du Créac’h, se racontent un voyage immobile et une expérience d’immersion au contact des éléments et des îliens. Elle explore les lieux et rencontre les habitants, les derniers marins de commerce, les guetteurs-sémaphoriques et gardiens de phares, et les femmes, gardiennes des lieux, qui occupent une place prépondérante sur cette île du Ponant. On découvre cet espace à part, territoire de l’extrême entretenant un rapport particulier à la noirceur et à la mort. Face à la mer et sous les faisceaux du grand phare, l’auteure vit cette expérience comme une renaissance dans le passage et l’exil que représente l’écriture. Gwenaëlle Abolivier est journaliste et auteure. Elle est une voix de France Inter. Elle présente pendant plus de vingt ans des émissions de grands reportages où elle raconte ses voyages à travers le monde.

À la naissance de sa fille Mollie, il s’est rangé des planches. À ses douze ans, lorsqu’elle se révèle une grimpeuse-née, l’écrivain-reporter décide de la suivre dans son apprentissage. Tandis que Mollie endosse le rôle d’entraîneur et de mentor, voire de gourou, son père se doit de repousser sans cesse ses limites pour suivre son rythme, bousculant quelque peu la dynamique parent-enfant. Il raconte alors l’escalade comme l’envers de sa propre obsession pour l’eau, non plus la quête éperdue de ces “montagnes qui chancellent au milieu de l’océan”, mais la recherche frénétique de vagues tortueuses en forme de pics à gravir. À travers ce récit d’initiation, William Finnegan nous guide dans le monde singulier de la grimpe – des salles d’escalade de New York ou des blocs de Central Park aux parois rocheuses du Vermont ou aux falaises du Mexique et du Canada. Mollie, adolescente douce et ironique, ouvre la voie, et ce qui commence comme un passe-temps pour le père et la fille devient vite une obsession où toute occasion est bonne pour enfiler les chaussons et attaquer les “<i>problèmes</i>’’ sur le mur ou les “<i>itinéraires</i>’’ sur la paroi. Ensemble, ils apprennent un nouveau langage et se forgent de nouveaux souvenirs. À mesure qu’ils se lancent dans des ascensions toujours plus hautes et toujours plus délicates, ils font aussi l’apprentissage d’une notion cardinale : l’expérience du danger, ce que les grimpeurs nomment l’exposition. Et en creux, une leçon de vie simple mais décisive : tomber, c’est être humain. Formidable plongée dans le monde de l’escalade, <i>Avec Mollie</i> offre un regard tendre, bienveillant sur cette relation unique entre un père et une fille.","isbn_10":"2364685729","isbn_13":"9782364685727","asin":"","page_count":94,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=JOYrEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71IYik0SZi89xKhsrdk-hjmSlsBmVWII80Ra4yMZdnUD6bsYal1fuIt7qBTNmN41D8sGo1CBiBfkWyI1-m_RSSZXBTI9ummUdPGw2xN2CJBhz1OUihAQ4JbvGJeez8XmukEoKXY&source=gbs_api","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:09.101272Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:09.438548Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/1vodUptXgU/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/JOYrEAAAQBAJ/avec-mollie"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:12.772673Z","finished_reading_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:26.717952Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:09.108996Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T15:57:26.718102Z","user_review":{"id":"y5bE0wN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/y5bE0wN/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":["Page-turner"]},"page_count":94,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"8eYkz38","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/8eYkz38/","book":{"id":"V8MWpk5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/V8MWpk5/","share_identifier":"8QLkgPrDBS","slug":"le-syndrome-de-palo-alto","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"MJfFDwAAQBAJ","source_etag":"li7MOJ9osVU","title":"Le Syndrome de Palo Alto","subtitle":"roman","authors":["Loïc Hecht"],"publisher":"Editions Léo Scheer","published_date":"2020-01-08","description":"San Francisco, creuset de la révolution numérique qui a déferlé sur nos existences.

Quand on boit on est festif, irrévérent, drôle. Français. Un jour pourtant, Claire arrête de boire. Elle prend conscience que cet alcool, prétendument bon-vivant, est en vérité en train de ronger sa vie. Il noyaute ses journées, altère sa pensée, abîme ses relations. En retraçant son passé, elle découvre à quel point l’alcool a été le pilier de sa construction et de son personnage de femme. Sans alcool est le journal de son sevrage. Un chemin tortueux, parfois rocambolesque, à travers son intimité. Une quête de libération complexe, dans un pays qui sanctifie le pinard. L’autrice affronte son passé, l’héritage familial, le jugement des autres. Son récit interroge, au-delà de son expérience. Pourquoi boire est une telle norme sociale ? Alors qu’on lui a toujours vendu la sobriété comme le choix des cons et des culs bénis, elle réalise qu’on l’a sans doute flouée.

Il est le garçon en vue du lycée, elle est la solitaire un peu maladroite. Pourtant, l’étincelle se produit : le fils de la femme de ménage et l’intello hautaine connaissent ensemble leur premier amour. Un an plus tard, alors que Marianne s’épanouit au Trinity College de Dublin, Connell s’acclimate mal à la vie universitaire. Un jour, tout est léger, irrésistible ; le lendemain, le drame pointe et les sentiments vacillent. Entre eux, le jeu vient tout juste de commencer. Sally Rooney réussit le tour de force de donner une dimension unique et universelle à cette histoire. Porté par des dialogues saisissants de justesse, Normal People est un roman magistral sur la jeunesse, l’amitié, le sexe, sur les errances affectives et intellectuelles d’une génération qui n’a plus le droit de rêver, mais qui s’entête à espérer. Traduit de l’anglais (Irlande) par Stéphane Roques.","isbn_10":"2823615253","isbn_13":"9782823615258","asin":"","page_count":220,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=88QfEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72zFQsSHgEQxFg5QMUsJuMTZkj8m7uOQAuGyIWfvvM060XRLoFIomC-_t_mWu4N21BTDvmwLVMm7fPV_wah6aa1Qf35-HErL-GiJhaEujnRc53_Vi_YbhFValnnuYpTsQriKNWo&source=gbs_api","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T19:00:03.597358Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T19:00:04.199087Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/OurQQ9KzVO/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/88QfEAAAQBAJ/normal-people-3"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2021-03-26T19:00:08.447948Z","finished_reading_at":"2021-03-26T19:00:18.413614Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T19:00:03.617054Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T19:00:18.413794Z","user_review":{"id":"BN9edZN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/BN9edZN/","thoughts":"","rating":"3.5","review_tags":["Fantastic"]},"page_count":220,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"V8MLEKv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/V8MLEKv/","book":{"id":"dvZ2ePv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/dvZ2ePv/","share_identifier":"ghQs7wIRef","slug":"miss-islande","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"Ex-tDwAAQBAJ","source_etag":"MSJCsK5+ZZw","title":"Miss Islande","subtitle":"","authors":["Audur Ava Olafsdottir"],"publisher":"Editions Zulma","published_date":"2019-09-05","description":"Islande, 1963 – cent quatre-vingt mille habitants à peine, un prix Nobel de littérature, une base américaine, deux avions transatlantiques, voilà pour le décor. Hekla, vingt et un ans, emballe quelques affaires, sa machine à écrire, laisse derrière elle la ferme de ses parents et prend le car pour Reykjavík avec quatre manuscrits au fond de sa valise. Il est temps pour elle d’accomplir son destin : elle sera écrivain. Sauf qu’à la capitale, on lui conseille de tenter sa chance à l’élection de Miss Islande au lieu de perdre son temps à noircir du papier. Entre deux petits boulots, Hekla se réfugie chez Ísey, amie d’enfance convertie en mère de famille par un amour de vacances. Ou auprès de Jón John, fils illégitime d’un soldat américain qui rêve de quitter son île pour vivre de stylisme et de l’amour d’un autre homme... Avec la sensibilité, l’humour et la délicatesse qui lui sont si personnels, Auður Ava Ólafsdóttir interroge dans son sixième roman la relation de deux pionniers qui ne tiennent pas dans les cases, prisonniers d’un monde lilliputien et conservateur. Miss Islande est un magnifique roman sur la liberté, la création et l’accomplissement.","isbn_10":"2843048680","isbn_13":"9782843048685","asin":"","page_count":251,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content?id=Ex-tDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE70nY56jX_L8HsAqxBxpxcUcx5InLKf9FWUOxhIrikop1vlyQxcZ1PAkJyeglZSwhZDcN-veXlbbkowiZ9Pvbt4mlSIBj6vtNZksbvnBWE-Wawq-JoCJCRQJJL1h9GOOCMoHxWR6&source=gbs_api","language":"fr","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:59.837674Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:59:00.159114Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/ghQs7wIRef/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/Ex-tDwAAQBAJ/miss-islande"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":0,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":null,"started_reading_at":"2021-03-26T18:59:04.288352Z","finished_reading_at":"2021-03-26T18:59:29.719999Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:59.844764Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:59:29.720147Z","user_review":{"id":"BN9exZN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/BN9exZN/","thoughts":"","rating":"3.5","review_tags":["Enriching"]},"page_count":251,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"2vEW99N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/2vEW99N/","book":{"id":"q5gXeBv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/q5gXeBv/","share_identifier":"yHo4PhF8AB","slug":"surf-city","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THq6p2d3z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Surf City","subtitle":"","authors":["Kem Nunn"],"publisher":"Gallimard, Editions","published_date":"2003-09-01","description":"","isbn_10":"2070304817","isbn_13":"9782070304813","asin":"","page_count":null,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://www.italictype.com/static/images/bookcover-not-found.png","language":"","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:50.865163Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:50.865270Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/yHo4PhF8AB/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THq6p2d3z73P/surf-city"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2021-01-26","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2021-01-26T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:50.888045Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:50.900794Z","user_review":{"id":"0NYodJv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/0NYodJv/","thoughts":"","rating":"3.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":null,"percent_complete":null},{"id":"6vLbkaN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/6vLbkaN/","book":{"id":"r5nGAmv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/r5nGAmv/","share_identifier":"CM7qq28one","slug":"rusty-brown","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THaDssp7z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Rusty Brown","subtitle":"","authors":["Chris Ware"],"publisher":"Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","published_date":"2019-09-24","description":"<b>***FINALIST FOR THE&nbsp;2020 PEN/JEAN STEIN BOOK AWARD***<br /> <br /> ***&nbsp;<i>NEW YORK TIMES</i>&nbsp;100 NOTABLE BOOKS OF THE YEAR ***<br /> <br /> A major graphic novel event more than 18 years in progress: part one of the ongoing bifurcated masterwork from the brilliant and beloved author of <i>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</i> and <i>Building Stories.</i></b><br /> <br /> <i>Rusty Brown</i> is a fully interactive, full-color articulation of the time-space interrelationships of three complete consciousnesses in the first half of a single midwestern American day and the tiny piece of human grit about which they involuntarily orbit.

His new work,<i>Breath</i>, is an extraordinary evocation of an adolescence spent resisting complacency, testing one's limits against nature, finding like-minded souls, and discovering just how far one breath will take you. It's a story of extremes--extreme sports and extreme emotions.</p> <p>On the wild, lonely coast of Western Australia, two thrillseeking and barely adolescent boys fall into the enigmatic thrall of veteran big-wave surfer Sando. Together they form an odd but elite trio. The grown man initiates the boys into a kind of Spartan ethos, a regimen of risk and challenge, where they test themselves in storm swells on remote and shark-infested reefs, pushing each other to the edges of endurance, courage, and sanity. But where is all this heading? Why is their mentor's past such forbidden territory? And what can explain his American wife's peculiar behavior? Venturing beyond all limits--in relationships, in physical challenge, and in sexual behavior--there is a point where oblivion is the only outcome. Full of Winton's lyrical genius for conveying physical sensation, <i>Breath</i> is a rich and atmospheric coming-of-age tale from one of world literature's finest storytellers.</p>","isbn_10":"0374116342","isbn_13":"9780374116347","asin":"","page_count":224,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/3814/9780374116347_c490737f8a8a41b8b57398ecb829c735.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:51.269629Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:51.269650Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/74hJ9B6RLo/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THaD8emrz73P/breath-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2021-01-06","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2021-01-06T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:51.301681Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:51.313666Z","user_review":{"id":"n82abZv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/n82abZv/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":224,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"n82eOyv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/n82eOyv/","book":{"id":"JvQ6rY8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/JvQ6rY8/","share_identifier":"vKStSF2YhD","slug":"under-the-stars","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THn9bDxPz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Under the Stars","subtitle":"A Journey into Light","authors":["Matt Gaw"],"publisher":"Elliott & Thompson, Limited","published_date":"2021-09-01","description":"<div>Moonlight, starlight, the ethereal glow of snow in winter.

They showed the world what punk could be, and they continue to spread their message one song, one show, one tour at a time-with no signs of stopping.","isbn_10":"0306922223","isbn_13":"9780306922220","asin":"","page_count":336,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/4270/9780306922220_77e2553023d64f47804e6e689e00fad5.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.137153Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.137180Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/DQawE7KAn1/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THadgYwAz73P/do-what-you-want"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-11-25","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-11-25T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.181010Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.202308Z","user_review":{"id":"k5yXK1N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/k5yXK1N/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":336,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"38Go2l8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/38Go2l8/","book":{"id":"E5JEYxN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/E5JEYxN/","share_identifier":"7JqXRIrOor","slug":"the-surfboard","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THn95FeKz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Surfboard","subtitle":"","authors":["Dan Kieran"],"publisher":"Unbound","published_date":"2019-11-12","description":"<i>The Surfboard</i> is Dan Kieran's account of a week he spent in Cornwall building a seven-foot surfboard, even though he had never surfed a day in his life.

As a journalist living in an island community, he had intended to write a light-hearted account of his progress towards surfing nirvana, but instead found himself facing danger, doubt and the spectre of childhood bereavement in an often wild and unwelcoming sea. Meanwhile on land, and back riding a skateboard after a 30-year-gap, David found himself facing bemusement, ridicule and the wrath of the medical profession. But his decision to turn back the clock to the 1970s would also prove remarkably life changing and, occasionally, utterly catastrophic. Warm, funny, touching and honest - with a strong dose of adrenalin - Board explores loss, ego, fear and fatherhood, charting a quest for inner peace against a backdrop of thundering Atlantic waves. At its heart, Board is an inspiring story about accepting some limitations and overcoming others, while completely ignoring common sense and social convention. \"Board tells it as it is. It s like this: don t stand on the sidelines. Don t let society s prejudices stop you living your dreams. Do confront your demons. Do skate, do surf. David Flanagan s tale is an inspirational and honest hymn to getting out there and living your life.\" Alex Wade, author of Amazing Surfing Stories, Surf Nation and Wrecking Machine.</div>","isbn_10":"1905916949","isbn_13":"9781905916948","asin":"","page_count":204,"binding":"E-Book","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/2187/9781905916948_51f9cee2ec1241b9a68062c04c92c779.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.910127Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.910146Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/WxCzB4vuqi/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THo889eKz73P/board"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-11-05","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-11-05T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.929415Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:56.951705Z","user_review":{"id":"38rQaXv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/38rQaXv/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":204,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"q5g0lXv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/q5g0lXv/","book":{"id":"rNw7RNO","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/rNw7RNO/","share_identifier":"JjNUwOpnm3","slug":"the-underground-railroad","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"xYtIDwAAQBAJ","source_etag":"kfil/hPYeEs","title":"The Underground Railroad","subtitle":"","authors":["Colson Whitehead"],"publisher":"Anchor Books, a division of Penguin Random House LLC","published_date":"2018-01-30","description":"<b>#1 <i>New York Times </i>Bestseller - Winner of the Pulitzer Prize - Winner of the National Book Award - Winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction - Longlisted for the Man Booker Prize <p> One of the Best books of the Year: <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post, </i>NPR<i>, The Boston Globe, The Seattle Times, HuffPost, Esquire, Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></b><br> <b><i> </i></b><br> <b>Look for Whitehead's acclaimed new novel, <i>The Nickel Boys, </i>available now!</b> <p>Cora is a young slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. An outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is on the cusp of womanhood--where greater pain awaits. And so when Caesar, a slave who has recently arrived from Virginia, urges her to join him on the Underground Railroad, she seizes the opportunity and escapes with him. In Colson Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor: engineers and conductors operate a secret network of actual tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora embarks on a harrowing flight from one state to the next, encountering, like Gulliver, strange yet familiar iterations of her own world at each stop. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the terrors of the antebellum era, he weaves in the saga of our nation, from the brutal abduction of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. <i>The Underground Railroad </i>is both the gripping tale of one woman's will to escape the horrors of bondage--and a powerful meditation on the history we all share.","isbn_10":"0345804325","isbn_13":"9780345804327","asin":"","page_count":338,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=xYtIDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE714I-oNQnfGKellzLOcnQyyt0c99QFL632Nxyn4wKUTDm1O46C3ESe5BnuFN4tNtau0cFC9EJYOIfFwY7PD_AUP3W9RGgdpyFfVvYlLfT5qGqnkC1JYCL0EdTz4Su6_tRRsQyK8&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2019-11-02T15:15:10.305755Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T02:19:54.033088Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/JjNUwOpnm3/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/xYtIDwAAQBAJ/the-underground-railroad"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-10-31","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-10-31T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:57.053865Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:57:57.168030Z","user_review":{"id":"bv0omw5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/bv0omw5/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":338,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"E83eQp5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/E83eQp5/","book":{"id":"0vaRbB8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/0vaRbB8/","share_identifier":"CdE2t80kRH","slug":"utopia-for-realists-1","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"psA_DgAAQBAJ","source_etag":"2T5gWeqdRys","title":"Utopia for Realists","subtitle":"How We Can Build the Ideal World","authors":["Rutger Bregman"],"publisher":"Little, Brown","published_date":"2017-03-14","description":"<b>Universal basic income.

One of Europe's leading young thinkers shows how we can build an ideal world today.</b><br><br> \"A more politically radical Malcolm Gladwell.\" -- <i>New York Times</i><br><br> After working all day at jobs we often dislike, we buy things we don't need. Rutger Bregman, a Dutch historian, reminds us it needn't be this way -- and in some places it isn't. Rutger Bregman's TED Talk about universal basic income seemed impossibly radical when he delivered it in 2014.

It's just one of the many utopian ideas that Bregman proves is possible today. <br><br><i>Utopia for Realists</i> is one of those rare books that takes you by surprise and challenges what you think can happen. From a Canadian city that once completely eradicated poverty, to Richard Nixon's near implementation of a basic income for millions of Americans, Bregman takes us on a journey through history, and beyond the traditional left-right divides, as he champions ideas whose time have come. <br><br> Every progressive milestone of civilization -- from the end of slavery to the beginning of democracy -- was once considered a utopian fantasy. Bregman's book, both challenging and bracing, demonstrates that new utopian ideas, like the elimination of poverty and the creation of the fifteen-hour workweek, can become a reality in our lifetime.

Rachel Carson's rare ability to combine scientific insight with moving, poetic prose catapulted her book to first place on The New York Times best-seller list, where itenjoyed wide attention for thirty-one consecutive weeks. It remained on the list for more than a year and a half and ultimately sold well over a million copies, has been translated into 28 languages, inspired an Academy Award-winning documentary, and won both the 1952 National Book Award and theJohn Burroughs Medal.This classic work remains as fresh today as when it first appeared. Carson's writing teems with stunning, memorable images--the newly formed Earth cooling beneath an endlessly overcast sky; the centuries of nonstop rain that created the oceans; giant squids battling sperm whales hundreds offathoms below the surface; and incredibly powerful tides moving 100 billion tons of water daily in the Bay of Fundy. Quite simply, she captures the mystery and allure of the ocean with a compelling blend of imagination and expertise.Reintroducing a classic work to a whole new generation of readers, this Special Edition features a new chapter written by Jeffrey Levinton, a leading expert in marine ecology, that brings the scientific side of The Sea Around Us completely up to date.

Paris is an old Sufi cat who keeps watch over his brilliant yet pathetic master, Sammy Kamau-Williams, the Enchanter.

She empowers readers to think about their stuff and the environment in a new way, helping them make more informed choices when it comes to the future of our world.<br><br> Most importantly, this is a book about the power we have as voters and consumers to make sure that the fight against climate change includes all of us and all of our stuff, not just industry groups and politicians.

By midyear, a widely reported accident jeopardized the survival of both. And in his months of recovery, the link between writing and living became more crucial than ever. Rarely has a book on writing been so clear, so useful, and so revealing. On Writing begins with a mesmerizing account of King's childhood and his uncannily early focus on writing to tell a story. A series of vivid memories from adolescence, college, and the struggling years that led up to his first novel, Carrie, will afford readers a fresh and often very funny perspective on the formation of a writer. King next turns to the basic tools of his trade -- how to sharpen and multiply them through use, and how the writer must always have them close at hand. He takes the reader through crucial aspects of the writer's art and life, offering practical and inspiring advice on everything from plot and character development to work habits and rejection. Serialized in the New Yorker to vivid acclaim, On Writing culminates with a profoundly moving account of how King's overwhelming need to write spurred him toward recovery, and brought him back to his life. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower--and entertain--everyone who reads it.","isbn_10":"1444723251","isbn_13":"9781444723250","asin":"","page_count":351,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=gsFl5AAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71xLRXwQHaIUtAm6dJ16j-z1_qdV9NF17ajLK-eFC7ecuOtuDJ4T5u4dTvJ6PE0S3QYIBjdPtiE3QtenZB6J_uIZhkCd0eGgjJ6uiB8ofz4MQpWmC6fEaiDMaDLrzxUstQqOpyZ&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2020-06-06T20:13:52.514871Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T20:13:52.723600Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/QWfWoiTGM6/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/gsFl5AAACAAJ/on-writing"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-06-17","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-06-17T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:01.060398Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:01.087667Z","user_review":{"id":"BN9elxN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/BN9elxN/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":351,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"q8W3Or8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/q8W3Or8/","book":{"id":"1NmEMXN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/1NmEMXN/","share_identifier":"1kdiJw66KN","slug":"there-is-no-planet-b","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THh5ow5Fz73P","source_etag":"","title":"There Is No Planet B","subtitle":"A Handbook for the Make or Break Years","authors":["Mike Berners-Lee"],"publisher":"Cambridge University Press","published_date":"2019-02-28","description":"Feeding the world, climate change, biodiversity, antibiotics, plastics - the list of concerns seems endless.

A superb outing from a gifted young critic that will spark joy in many readers.\" -<i>Kirkus Reviews, </i>starred review </b><br><b> </b><br>“Less is more”: Everywhere we hear the mantra. Marie Kondo and other decluttering gurus promise that shedding our stuff will solve our problems. We commit to cleanse diets and strive for inbox zero. Amid the frantic pace and distraction of everyday life, we covet silence-and airy, Instagrammable spaces in which to enjoy it. The popular term for this brand of upscale austerity, “minimalism,” has mostly come to stand for things to buy and consume. But minimalism has richer, deeper, and altogether more valuable gifts to offer. <br> <br>Kyle Chayka is one of our sharpest cultural observers. After spending years covering minimalist trends for leading publications, he now delves beneath this lifestyle's glossy surface, seeking better ways to claim the time and space we crave. He shows that our longing for less goes back further than we realize. His search leads him to the philosophical and spiritual origins of minimalism, and to the stories of artists such as Agnes Martin and Donald Judd; composers such as John Cage and Julius Eastman; architects and designers; visionaries and misfits. As Chayka looks anew at their extraordinary lives and explores the places where they worked-from Manhattan lofts to the Texas high desert and the back alleys of Kyoto-he reminds us that what we most require is presence, not absence. The result is an elegant new synthesis of our minimalist desires and our profound emotional needs.","isbn_10":"1635572118","isbn_13":"9781635572117","asin":"","page_count":183,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z_OhDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73I3E_J0kPuKaRZI_FCmSdG6RDm_kDPr78TuG2d3ZJhqmgIw5LVz87eNDvTqfmkkbVtUHAn9ejGHAIKnYvAidM7stXPVsW3yvnRmloVE-JTWGgxfkL608cKxvcnSPFO3Wx69omN&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2020-01-10T21:57:15.962304Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T21:57:16.309965Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/Z5av7WlImQ/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/Z_OhDwAAQBAJ/the-longing-for-less"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2020-02-12","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2020-02-12T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:04.815758Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:04.873856Z","user_review":{"id":"0NYoDbv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/0NYoDbv/","thoughts":"A few good portraits. <br/>I came for the minimalism, stayed for the stories.<br/>I laughed and enjoyed the historical touches.<br/><br/>I don’t think I like the almost condescending tone it can come around for current minimalists but I definitively liked the lesson on the sources of this movement.","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":183,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"gNqXdw8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/gNqXdw8/","book":{"id":"y5bdaG8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/y5bdaG8/","share_identifier":"89TtpWBCni","slug":"the-salt-path","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1TH90hpDwz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Salt Path","subtitle":"A Memoir","authors":["Raynor Winn"],"publisher":"Penguin Publishing Group","published_date":"2019-03-05","description":"<b>\"Polished, poignant... an inspiring story of true love.\"--<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br /> <br /> A BEST BOOK OF 2019,&nbsp;NPR's Book Concierge<br /> SHORTLISTED FOR THE COSTA BOOK AWARD<br /> OVER 400,000 COPIES SOLD WORLDWIDE<br /> <br /> The true story of a couple who lost everything and embarked on a transformative journey walking the South West Coast Path in England</b><br /> <br /> Just days after Raynor Winn learns that Moth, her husband of thirty-two years, is terminally ill, their house and farm are taken away, along with their livelihood.

Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.</b><br /> <br /> In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of <i>Deep Work</i> introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives.<br /> <br /> Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience \"fear of missing out\" because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction.<br /> <br /> Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don't go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions.<br /> <br /> Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day \"digital declutter\" process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.<br /> <br /> Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you. This book shows the way.","isbn_10":"0525536515","isbn_13":"9780525536512","asin":"","page_count":304,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/3017/9780525536512_0bf2aecf00b749f088e12cb4971be014.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T17:33:23.320474Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T17:33:23.320498Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/HG4msiNaoe/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THbR2RpLz73P/digital-minimalism-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2019-12-15","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2019-12-15T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:05.711248Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:05.763895Z","user_review":{"id":"Y8dXl38","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/Y8dXl38/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":304,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"q8W3ar8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/q8W3ar8/","book":{"id":"E5JEbxN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/E5JEbxN/","share_identifier":"zA86sNrvFP","slug":"in-waves","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THo9Rotmz73P","source_etag":"","title":"In Waves","subtitle":"","authors":["A.

In his new book, <i>Stillness Is the Key</i>, Holiday draws on timeless Stoic and Buddhist philosophy to show why slowing down is the secret weapon for those charging ahead.</b><br> <br> All great leaders, thinkers, artists, athletes, and visionaries share one indelible quality. It enables them to conquer their tempers. To avoid distraction and discover great insights. To achieve happiness and do the right thing. Ryan Holiday calls it stillness--to be steady while the world spins around you.<br> <br> In this book, he outlines a path for achieving this ancient, but urgently necessary way of living. Drawing on a wide range of history's greatest thinkers, from Confucius to Seneca, Marcus Aurelius to Thich Nhat Hanh, John Stuart Mill to Nietzsche, he argues that stillness is not mere inactivity, but the doorway to self-mastery, discipline, and focus.<br> <br> Holiday also examines figures who exemplified the power of stillness: baseball player Sadaharu Oh, whose study of Zen made him the greatest home run hitter of all time; Winston Churchill, who in balancing his busy public life with time spent laying bricks and painting at his Chartwell estate managed to save the world from annihilation in the process; Fred Rogers, who taught generations of children to see what was invisible to the eye; Anne Frank, whose journaling and love of nature guided her through unimaginable adversity.<br> <br> More than ever, people are overwhelmed. They face obstacles and egos and competition. <i>Stillness Is the Key</i> offers a simple but inspiring antidote to the stress of 24/7 news and social media.

His idea was to walk through the country, earning money for food by playing his violin in bars and plazas.</p> <p>Nearly a century later, the book Laurie Lee wrote - As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning - inspired Alastair Humphreys. It made him fall in love with Spain - the landscapes and the spirit - and with Laurie's style of travel. He travelled slow, lived simply, slept on hilltops, relished spontaneity, and loved conversations with the different people he met along the hot and dusty road.</p> <p>For 15 years, Alastair dreamed of retracing Laurie Lee's footsteps, but could never get past the hurdle of being distinctly unmusical. This year, he decided to go anyway. The journey was his most terrifying yet, risking failure and humiliation every day, and finding himself truly vulnerable to the rhythms of the road and of his own life. But along the way, he found humility, redemption and triumph.

Each has a story to tell of a time when they were vulnerable, when they were in need and a kind stranger came to their rescue.<br /> <br /> These are stories that make our hearts grow, stories that will restore our faith in the world and remind us that, despite what the media says, the world isn't a scary place - rather, it is filled with Kind Strangers just like us.","isbn_10":"1786855313","isbn_13":"9781786855312","asin":"","page_count":320,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/4408/9781786855312_99700cda399347c7a04d1d27cb7df583.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:11.561952Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:11.561978Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/0er3hLmnAd/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THna6kExz73P/the-kindness-of-strangers"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2019-03-18","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2019-03-18T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:11.585838Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:11.649687Z","user_review":{"id":"oNK6bo8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/oNK6bo8/","thoughts":"So many good stories of random acts of kindness and so many new books I wanna read","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":320,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"K8OoXM8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/K8OoXM8/","book":{"id":"PvzPAON","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/PvzPAON/","share_identifier":"lLmilZSb5n","slug":"the-arab-of-the-future-4","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THi81kDQz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Arab of the Future 4","subtitle":"","authors":["Riad Sattouf"],"publisher":"Henry Holt & Company","published_date":"2019-11-05","description":"<p><b>The penultimate installment in the bestselling French graphic memoir series--hailed as \"exquisitely illustrated\" and \"irresistible\"--covering the years of Riad Sattouf's adolescence, from 1987-1992.</b><br /> <br /> In the fourth volume of<i>The Arab of the Future</i>, little Riad has grown into a teenager.

While putting one arm over the other, sometimes resting on his back, Minihane begins to confront the often buried issues in his life. Along the way, he rekindles old friendships and forges new ones, and after an unexpected setback discovers that he has already gained enough strength to be able to continue his recovery on dry land. The activity that he describes is both strange and beautiful, as the wild water puts him in touch with nature and himself.Floating is a remarkable memoir about, on the surface, a passion for swimming and nature. Moving from darkness into light, it is as intense and moving as it is lyrical and generous. It captures in memorable detail Minihane's struggle to understand his life and move forward and, steeped in the anti-authoritarian and naturalistic spirit of Roger Deakin, celebrates the joy of taking time out to feel better.From Hampstead to Yorkshire, from Dorset to Jura, from the Isles of Scilly to Wales--with this book, Joe Minihane has written what is often a love letter to different wild stretches of water.

He washes up in Butcher&#8217;s Crossing, a small Kansas town on the outskirts of nowhere. <i>Butcher&#8217;s Crossing</i> is full of restless men looking for ways to make money and ways to waste it. Before long Andrews strikes up a friendship with one of them, a man who regales Andrews with tales of immense herds of buffalo, ready for the taking, hidden away in a beautiful valley deep in the Colorado Rockies. He convinces Andrews to join in an expedition to track the animals down. The journey out is grueling, but at the end is a place of paradisal richness. Once there, however, the three men abandon themselves to an orgy of slaughter, so caught up in killing buffalo that they lose all sense of time. Winter soon overtakes them: they are snowed in. Next spring, half-insane with cabin fever, cold, and hunger, they stagger back to Butcher&#8217;s Crossing to &#64257;nd a world as irremediably changed as they have been.","isbn_10":"1590171985","isbn_13":"9781590171981","asin":"","page_count":296,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/1149/9781590171981_b3ada96b23d94185a86608b76d2b2f96.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T16:48:06.263338Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T16:48:06.263357Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/Ia02Mrojjh/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THkB5eE6z73P/butchers-crossing"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2018-04-08","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2018-04-08T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:19.249878Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:19.294559Z","user_review":{"id":"nvxqL68","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/nvxqL68/","thoughts":"","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":296,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"oNKym7v","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/oNKym7v/","book":{"id":"0NY66K5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/0NY66K5/","share_identifier":"2EgtWDJBXi","slug":"la-desobeissance-civile","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THmFDxdwz73P","source_etag":"","title":"La désobéissance Civile","subtitle":"","authors":["Henry David Thoreau"],"publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","published_date":"2018-09-03","description":"La Désobéissance civile, titre original Civil Disobedience est un essai de Henry David Thoreau publié en 1849.

To initiates, it is something else: a beautiful addiction, a demanding course of study, a morally dangerous pastime, a way of life. <p>Raised in California and Hawaii, Finnegan started surfing as a child. He has chased waves all over the world, wandering for years through the South Pacific, Australia, Asia, Africa. A bookish boy, and then an excessively adventurous young man, he went on to become a distinguished writer and war reporter. <i>Barbarian Days</i> takes us deep into unfamiliar worlds, some of them right under our noses--off the coasts of New York and San Francisco. It immerses the reader in the edgy camaraderie of close male friendships forged in challenging waves. <p>Finnegan shares stories of life in a whites-only gang in a tough school in Honolulu. He shows us a world turned upside down for kids and adults alike by the social upheavals of the 1960s. He details the intricacies of famous waves and his own apprenticeships to them. Youthful folly--he drops LSD while riding huge Honolua Bay, on Maui--is served up with rueful humor. As Finnegan's travels take him ever farther afield, he discovers the picturesque simplicity of a Samoan fishing village, dissects the sexual politics of Tongan interactions with Americans and Japanese, and navigates the Indonesian black market while nearly succumbing to malaria. Throughout, he surfs, carrying readers with him on rides of harrowing, unprecedented lucidity. <p><i>Barbarian Days </i>is an old-school adventure story, an intellectual autobiography, a social history, a literary road movie, and an extraordinary exploration of the gradual mastering of an exacting, little-understood art. <p><b>Praise for <i>Barbarian Days</i> </b> <p>\"Without a doubt, the finest surf book I've ever read . . . But on a more fundamental level, <i>Barbarian Days</i> offers a clear-eyed vision of American boyhood. Like Jon Krakauer's <i>Into the Wild</i>, it is a sympathetic examination of what happens when literary ideas of freedom and purity take hold of a young mind and fling his body out into the far reaches of the world.\"<i>--The New York Times Magazine</i><br><i> </i><br>\"Incandescent . . . I'd sooner press this book upon on a nonsurfer, in part because nothing I've read so accurately describes the feeling of being stoked or the despair of being held under. . . . [But] it's also about a writer's life and, even more generally, a quester's life, more carefully observed and precisely rendered than any I've read in a long time.\"<i>--Los Angeles Times</i><b><br></b>","isbn_10":"0143109391","isbn_13":"9780143109396","asin":"","page_count":466,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=GVgBDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE73u4AKNoKbzIgJBgJubYCvQir_3xmw-tIruBnMrbo4Ez6pUTd4f7tKR1nX4fRJctnxdwqYfQga4z0ocsA-Xj63PL2aEwewVIL0wzixW6Kr37dcvYjPTTV_Vs88e7rchlizCX1y6&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2020-01-29T01:18:44.130310Z","updated_at":"2020-12-16T02:19:54.520644Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/LqYHPqiYMU/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/GVgBDAAAQBAJ/barbarian-days"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2018-02-17","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2018-02-17T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:20.848617Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:20.892204Z","user_review":{"id":"PvzKP28","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/PvzKP28/","thoughts":"I had hard times with surf jargon at first and probably still do but this story was an amazing life to read about.<br/><br/>The waves are calling and I wanna go","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":466,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"6vLbm2N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/6vLbm2N/","book":{"id":"zNpzjEv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/zNpzjEv/","share_identifier":"G0Y10fDL6d","slug":"vacationland","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"XCw8DwAAQBAJ","source_etag":"Rf3G86RxkxY","title":"Vacationland","subtitle":"True Stories from Painful Beaches","authors":["John Hodgman"],"publisher":"Penguin","published_date":"2017","description":"<b>\"I love everything about this hilarious book except the font size.\" <b>--Jon Stewart</b> <p>Although his career as a bestselling author and on <i>The Daily Show With Jon Stewart</i> was founded on fake news and invented facts, in 2016 that routine didn't seem as funny to John Hodgman anymore.

In fact, the most common enemy lies within: our ego. Early in our careers, it impedes learning and the cultivation of talent. With success, it can blind us to our faults and sow future problems. In failure, it magnifies each blow and makes recovery more difficult. At every stage, ego holds us back. <br> <br><i>Ego Is the Enemy </i>draws on a vast array of stories and examples, from literature to philosophy to his­tory. We meet fascinating figures such as George Marshall, Jackie Robinson, Katharine Graham, Bill Belichick, and Eleanor Roosevelt, who all reached the highest levels of power and success by con­quering their own egos. Their strategies and tactics can be ours as well. <br> <br>In an era that glorifies social media, reality TV, and other forms of shameless self-promotion, the battle against ego must be fought on many fronts.

Eloquent... A heart-rending drama of human yearning.\" --<i>New York Times</i></b><br /> <br /> In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter.&nbsp;&nbsp;How&nbsp;Christopher Johnson McCandless&nbsp;came to die is the unforgettable story of <i>Into the Wild</i>.<br /> <br /> Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.<br /> <br /> Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless's short life. Admitting an interst that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the dries and desires that propelled McCandless. Digging deeply, he takes an inherently compelling mystery and unravels the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind; the complex, charged bond between fathers and sons.<br /> <br /> When McCandless's innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naiveté, pretensions, and hubris. He is said to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless's uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity, and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding--and not an ounce of sentimentality. Mesmerizing, heartbreaking, <i>Into the Wild</i> is a <i>tour de force</i>. The power and luminosity of Jon Krakauer's stoytelling blaze through every page.","isbn_10":"0385486804","isbn_13":"9780385486804","asin":"","page_count":240,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/423/9780385486804_28343774f85c4996867498f6f0410fde.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-25T16:01:59.745132Z","updated_at":"2021-03-25T16:01:59.745150Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/ERceclm9EQ/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THaHTYAmz73P/into-the-wild"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2017-11-14","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2017-11-14T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:22.489686Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:22.531321Z","user_review":{"id":"O8oglL8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/O8oglL8/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":240,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"r5nRYV5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/r5nRYV5/","book":{"id":"zNpPPgN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/zNpPPgN/","share_identifier":"U2I9appelY","slug":"simplicity-parenting","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THipf50Kz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Simplicity Parenting","subtitle":"Using the Extraordinary Power of Less to Raise Calmer, Happier, and More Secure Kids","authors":["Kim John Payne","Lisa M.

Wild is angry, brave, sad, self-knowing, redemptive, raw, compelling, and brilliantly written, and I think it's destined to be loved by a lot of people, men and women, for a very long time.' --Nick Hornby<br /> <br /> At twenty-six, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother's rapid death from cancer, her family disbanded and her marriage crumbled. With nothing to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to walk eleven-hundred miles of the west coast of America - from the Mojave Desert, through California and Oregon, and into Washington state - and to do it alone. She had no experience of long-distance hiking and the journey was nothing more than a line on a map. But it held a promise - a promise of piecing together a life that lay in ruins at her feet.<br /> <br /> Strayed's account captures the agonies - both mental and physical - of her incredible journey; how it maddened and terrified her, and how, ultimately, it healed her.

Twenty-something, suit-clad, and upwardly mobile, Joshua Fields Millburn thought he had everything anyone could ever want. Until he didn't anymore. Blindsided by the loss of his mother and his marriage in the same month, Millburn started questioning every aspect of the life he had built for himself. Then, he accidentally discovered a lifestyle known as minimalism...and everything started to change. That was four years ago. Since, Millburn, now 32, has embraced simplicity. In the pursuit of looking for something more substantial than compulsory consumption and the broken American Dream, he jettisoned most of his material possessions, paid off loads of crippling debt, and walked away from his six-figure career. So, when everything was gone, what was left? Not a how-to book but a why-to book, Everything That Remains is the touching, surprising story of what happened when one young man decided to let go of everything and begin living more deliberately. Heartrending, uplifting, and deeply personal, this engrossing memoir is peppered with insightful (and often hilarious) interruptions by Ryan Nicodemus, Millburn's best friend of twenty years.","isbn_10":"1938793188","isbn_13":"9781938793189","asin":"","page_count":null,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/5765/9781938793189_b453476ba0e74704861d7fb8dbe435f4.jpg","language":"","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:26.746762Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:26.746782Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/FMA3YqbplJ/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THoj9pbjz73P/everything-that-remains"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2017-05-02","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2017-05-02T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:26.770540Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:26.821817Z","user_review":{"id":"38GnLgv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/38GnLgv/","thoughts":"An easy to read memoir. <br/>I especially like the conversation through footnotes.<br/>","rating":"4.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":null,"percent_complete":null},{"id":"dvZ49rN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/dvZ49rN/","book":{"id":"0NY03K8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/0NY03K8/","share_identifier":"HhVKQyYoU9","slug":"the-managers-path","source_name":"GoogleBooksV1","source_uid":"zqNaDgAAQBAJ","source_etag":"EsYuDLqQ9Lw","title":"The Manager's Path","subtitle":"A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change","authors":["Camille Fournier"],"publisher":"\"O'Reilly Media, Inc.\"","published_date":"2017-03-13","description":"<p>Managing people is difficult wherever you work.

A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure, involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.</p> <p>We all have a voice in our head. It's what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we're not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we're stuck with this voice - that there's nothing we can do to rein it in - but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It's a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead, it's something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness.</p> <p>10% Happier takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America's spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives.</p>","isbn_10":"0062265423","isbn_13":"9780062265425","asin":"","page_count":256,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/3470/9780062265425_f3fac23718094c93aebcca73ca242f3e.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T17:21:04.048682Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T17:21:04.048707Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/gU39yb9kYj/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1TH8ixnqZz73P/10-happier-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2017-03-16","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2017-03-16T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:27.536440Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:27.582752Z","user_review":{"id":"0valEV5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/0valEV5/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":256,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"gNqXBE8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/gNqXBE8/","book":{"id":"0vammVv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/0vammVv/","share_identifier":"sSfNlnJh4R","slug":"youre-never-weird-on-the-internet-almost","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THjL8BP6z73P","source_etag":"","title":"You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost)","subtitle":"A Memoir","authors":["Felicia Day","Joss Whedon (Foreword by)"],"publisher":"Touchstone","published_date":"2015-08-11","description":"<b>The Instant <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller--Featuring a Foreword by Joss Whedon</b><br /> <br /> <b>\"Felicia Day is a lot of fun, and so is her book.\" --George R. R. Martin</b><br /> <br /> From online entertainment pioneer, actress, and \"queen of the geeks\" Felicia Day, <i>You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost)</i> is a \"relentlessly funny and surprisingly inspirational\" (Forbes.com), memoir about her unusual upbringing, her rise to internet stardom, and embracing her weirdness to find her place in the world.<br /> <br /> When Felicia Day was a girl, all she wanted was to connect with other kids (desperately). Growing up in the Deep South, where she was \"home-schooled for hippie reasons,\" she looked online to find her tribe. The internet was in its infancy and she became an early adopter at every stage of its growth--finding joy and unlikely friendships in the emerging digital world. Her relative isolation meant that she could pursue passions like gaming, calculus, and 1930's detective novels without shame. Because she had no idea how \"uncool\" she really was.<br /> <br /> But if it hadn't been for her strange background-- the awkwardness continued when she started college at sixteen, with Mom driving her to campus every day--she might never have had the naive confidence to forge her own path. Like when she graduated as valedictorian with a math degree and then headed to Hollywood to pursue a career in acting despite having zero contacts. Or when she tired of being typecast as the crazy cat-lady secretary and decided to create her own web series before people in show business understood that online video could be more than just cats chasing laser pointers.<br /> <br /> Felicia's rags-to-riches rise to internet fame launched her career as one of the most influen­tial creators in new media. Ever candid, she opens up about the rough patches along the way, recounting battles with writer's block, a full-blown gaming addiction, severe anxiety and depression--and how she reinvented herself when overachieving became overwhelming.<br /> <br /> Showcasing Felicia's \"engaging and often hilarious voice\" (<i>USA TODAY</i>), <i>You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost)</i> is proof that everyone should celebrate what makes them different and be brave enough to share it with the world, because anything is possible now--even for a digital misfit.","isbn_10":"1476785651","isbn_13":"9781476785653","asin":"","page_count":272,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/2879/9781476785653_539bc62826e147b4a99f9eea1ee85a77.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:25.178382Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:25.178405Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/sSfNlnJh4R/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THjL8BP6z73P/youre-never-weird-on-the-internet-almost"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2017-03-06","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2017-03-06T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:25.204515Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:25.247614Z","user_review":null,"page_count":272,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"oNKydOv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/oNKydOv/","book":{"id":"dNV22MN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/dNV22MN/","share_identifier":"uIlqPSDu2B","slug":"the-big-tiny","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THaQoounz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Big Tiny","subtitle":"A Built-It-Myself Memoir","authors":["Dee Williams"],"publisher":"Penguin Publishing Group","published_date":"2014-04-22","description":"Dee Williams's life changed in an instant, with a near-death experience in the aisle of her local grocery store. Diagnosed with a heart condition at age forty-one, she was all too suddenly reminded that life is short, time is precious, and she wanted to be spending hers with the people and things she truly loved. That included the beautiful sprawling house in the Pacific Northwest she had painstakingly restored--but, increasingly, it did not include the mortgage payments, constant repairs, and general time-suck of home ownership. A new sense of clarity began to take hold: Just what was all this <i>stuff</i> for? Multiple extra rooms, a kitchen stocked with rarely used appliances, were things that couldn't compare with the financial freedom and the ultimate luxury--<i>time--</i>that would come with downsizing.<br /> <br /> Deciding to build an eighty-four-square-foot house--on her own, from the ground up--was just the beginning of building a new life. Williams can now list everything she owns on one sheet of paper, her monthly housekeeping bills amount to about eight dollars, and it takes her approximately ten minutes to clean the entire house. It's left her with more time to spend with family and friends, and given her freedom to head out for adventure at a moment's notice, or watch the clouds and sunset while drinking a beer on her (yes, tiny) front porch.<br /> <br /> The lessons Williams learned from her \"aha\" moment post-trauma apply to all of us, every day, regardless of whether or not we decide to discard all our worldly belongings. Part how-to, part personal memoir, <i>The Big Tiny</i> is an utterly seductive meditation on the benefits of slowing down, scaling back, and appreciating the truly important things in life.","isbn_10":"0399166173","isbn_13":"9780399166174","asin":"","page_count":304,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/3103/9780399166174_e8c5ca1b61e24e25ab7eadeb86ddd8e3.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:27.665130Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:27.665149Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/uIlqPSDu2B/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THaQoounz73P/the-big-tiny"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2017-01-22","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2017-01-22T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:27.684039Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:27.732513Z","user_review":{"id":"q5gO7y5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/q5gO7y5/","thoughts":"Nice memoir of someone who downsized her living to find what is essential in the end...

He is being menaced by a strange man in a flat cap - a wanted criminal who seems to have followed him all the way from America. In the days that follow, his home is robbed, his family is threatened. And then the first murder takes place.<br /> <br /> Almost unwillingly, Holmes and Watson find themselves being drawn ever deeper into an international conspiracy connected to the teeming criminal underworld of Boston, the gaslit streets of London, opium dens and much, much more. And as they dig, they begin to hear the whispered phrase-the House of Silk-a mysterious entity that connects the highest levels of government to the deepest depths of criminality. Holmes begins to fear that he has uncovered a conspiracy that threatens to tear apart the very fabric of society.<br /> <br /> The Arthur Conan Doyle Estate chose the celebrated, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Anthony Horowitz to write <i>The House of Silk</i> because of his proven ability to tell a transfixing story and for his passion for all things Holmes.

I'm going to share that mindset with you - along with hundreds of actionable techniques and proven habits - so you can shortcut those years. <p>Introducing <i>The Effective Engineer</i> - the only book designed specifically for today's software engineers, based on extensive interviews with engineering leaders at top tech companies, and packed with hundreds of techniques to accelerate your career. <p>For two years, I embarked on a quest seeking an answer to one question: <p><b>How do the most effective engineers make their efforts, their teams, and their careers more successful?</b> <p>I interviewed and collected stories from engineering VPs, directors, managers, and other leaders at today's top software companies: established, household names like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn; rapidly growing mid-sized companies like Dropbox, Square, Box, Airbnb, and Etsy; and startups like Reddit, Stripe, Instagram, and Lyft. <p>These leaders shared stories about the most valuable insights they've learned and the most common and costly mistakes that they've seen engineers - sometimes themselves - make. <p>This is just a small sampling of the hard questions I posed to them: <ul> <li>What engineering qualities correlate with future success? <li>What have you done that has paid off the highest returns? <li>What separates the most effective engineers you've worked with from everyone else? <li>What's the most valuable lesson your team has learned in the past year? <li>What advice do you give to new engineers on your team? </ul> <p>Everyone's story is different, but many of the lessons share common themes. <p>You'll get to hear stories like: <ul> <li>How did Instagram's team of 5 engineers build and support a service that grew to over 40 million users by the time the company was acquired? <li>How and why did Quora deploy code to production 40 to 50 times per day? <li>How did the team behind Google Docs become the fastest acquisition to rewrite its software to run on Google's infrastructure? <li>How does Etsy use continuous experimentation to design features that are <i>guaranteed</i> to increase revenue at launch? <li>How did Facebook's small infrastructure team effectively operate thousands of database servers? <li>How did Dropbox go from barely hiring any new engineers to nearly tripling its team size year-over-year? </ul> <p>What's more, I've distilled their stories into actionable habits and lessons that you can follow step-by-step to make your career and your team more successful. <p><b>The skills used by effective engineers are all learnable.</b> <p>And I'll teach them to you. With <i>The Effective Engineer</i>, I'll teach you a unifying framework called leverage - the value produced per unit of time invested - that you can use to identify the activities that produce disproportionate results. <p><b>Here's a sneak peek at some of the lessons you'll learn.</b> You'll learn how to: <ul> <li>Prioritize the right projects and tasks to increase your impact. <li>Earn more leeway from your peers and managers on your projects. <li>Spend less time <i>maintaining</i> and <i>fixing</i> software and more time <i>building</i> and <i>shipping</i> new features. <li>Produce more accurate software estimates. <li>Validate your ideas cheaply to reduce wasted work. <li>Navigate organizational and people-related bottlenecks. <li>Find the appropriate level of code reviews, testing, abstraction, and technical debt to balance speed and quality. <li>Shorten your debugging workflow to increase your iteration speed. <li>Use metrics to quantify your impact and consistently make progress. </ul>","isbn_10":"0996128107","isbn_13":"9780996128100","asin":"","page_count":260,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=1ShJrgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72IKcDLj51gmv1UHi406Ys0olJHyF0eAxUAB4-YehUk50VKmknef-Cbub4hQr75Z7R1GdmfCtg_jsC8nSNIthjB4zXEYsaaZTFXgJdWY-_DYSEP12YuZg3q3fP4FEHdopQjbm3N&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-02-21T06:41:36.883789Z","updated_at":"2021-02-21T06:41:37.149928Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/pX54ctmYAf/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/1ShJrgEACAAJ/the-effective-engineer"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2016-09-30","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2016-09-30T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:30.761091Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:30.830202Z","user_review":{"id":"oNK6pM8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/oNK6pM8/","thoughts":"This is a great book full of good advices for every engineer","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":260,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"38rpbX5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/38rpbX5/","book":{"id":"ZNlY2m5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/ZNlY2m5/","share_identifier":"f3qopiGflY","slug":"harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THkgDcTmz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child","subtitle":"Parts One and Two Playscript","authors":["J.

And positive people are significantly healthier and less stressed and enjoy deeper social interaction than the less positive people around them.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Drawing on his original research--including one of the largest studies of happiness ever conducted--and work in boardrooms and classrooms across forty-two countries, Achor shows us how to rewire our brains for positivity and optimism to reap the happiness advantage in our lives, our careers, and even our health. His strategies include:<br /> &nbsp;<br /> * The Tetris Effect: how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility so we can see and seize opportunities all around us<br /> * Social Investment: how to earn the dividends of a strong social support network<br /> * The Ripple Effect: how to spread positive change within our teams, companies, and families<br /> &nbsp;<br /> By turns fascinating, hopeful, and timely, <i>The Happiness Advantage</i> reveals how small shifts in our mind-set and habits can produce big gains at work, at home, and elsewhere.","isbn_10":"0307591549","isbn_13":"9780307591548","asin":"","page_count":256,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/4907/9780307591548_d7248ae112da4a19930bb54ef0a61949.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.526141Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.526174Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/Qv9OiyIDTA/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THadskokz73P/the-happiness-advantage-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2016-01-10","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2016-01-10T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.543114Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.599812Z","user_review":{"id":"y5bdjg8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/y5bdjg8/","thoughts":"Reading this reminds you of simple common sense, applying it is another thing.<br/>I really like the remainders and the stories linked to each points.<br/><br/>Starting to read and meditate, this book resonates in me.<br/>You get the small advices on how to start tricking the brain and moving to a more positive energy.<br/><br/>I think this helps coming to a more meaningful life.<br/>Focusing on the important, your happiness helped by f","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":256,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"q8W3Pe8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/q8W3Pe8/","book":{"id":"x57R3ZN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/x57R3ZN/","share_identifier":"yinlJupoQm","slug":"killing-and-dying","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THn4H2n4z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Killing and Dying","subtitle":"","authors":["Adrian Tomine"],"publisher":"Drawn & Quarterly Publications","published_date":"2015-10-06","description":"<p><b>\"One of the most gifted graphic novelists of our time.\" --</b><i><b>Wired</b></i><br /> <br /> <br /> <i>Killing and Dying</i> is a stunning showcase of the possibilities of the graphic novel medium and a wry exploration of loss, creative ambition, identity, and family dynamics.

The Carter Family: Don't Forget This Song is a rich and compelling original graphic novel that tells the story of the Carter Family--the first superstar group of country music--who made hundreds of recordings and sold millions of records. Many of their hit songs, such as \"Wildwood Flower\" and \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken,\" have influenced countless musicians and remain timeless country standards. The Carter Family: Don't Forget This Song is not only a unique illustrated biography, but a moving account that reveals the family's rise to success, their struggles along the way, and their impact on contemporary music. Illustrated with exacting detail and written in the Southern dialect of the time, its dynamic narrative is pure Americana. It is also a story of success and failure, of poverty and wealth, of racism and tolerance, of creativity and business, and of the power of music and love. Includes bonus CD with original Carter Family music. Praise for The Carter Family: \"What a fine marriage of form and content! Humble and moving--straightforward with occasional breathtaking bravura passages--this book echoes the Carter Family's rough-hewn sounds. It tells of the lives, sorrows, and values of a lost America in short episodes like a giant stack of old 78s. Using the vocabulary of comic strips like Little Orphan Annie and Gasoline Alley, it's as obsessive in its dedication to vernacular craft and hard work as A.P. Carter himself. Frank Young and David Lasky have spun a work of visual music that will replay in your head and heart well after you've finished reading it.\"--Art Spiegelman, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer/artist of Maus \"Charming, faithful, and resonant . . . will charm the pants off you.\" --The Comics Journal \"Lasky's gorgeous artwork animates the story and evokes a mood that mirrors the era and the music.\" --NPR.org \"Pure pleasure for anyone interested in music history.\" --The Seattle Times \"Cracking open The Carter Family feels like putting on a vintage 78: moody hearty Americana emanates hauntingly. Enlivening this graphic biography of the legendary country music family are both Frank M. Young's dialogue, which replicates the vernacular to a T but oh so naturally, and David Lasky's understated and elegant illustrations which resonate like the music they depict.\" --HeebMagazine.com","isbn_10":"0810988364","isbn_13":"9780810988361","asin":"","page_count":192,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/2161/9780810988361_ba2c08c7a8564956bfb70d8c2463aef5.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.794335Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.794411Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/0bv32a7XVj/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THe4J8Ktz73P/the-carter-family"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2015-09-05","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2015-09-05T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.821534Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:35.869339Z","user_review":null,"page_count":192,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"n82e2Zv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/n82e2Zv/","book":{"id":"PvzPq2N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/PvzPq2N/","share_identifier":"FMipZIct91","slug":"remote-pairing","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THoiPgyiz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Remote Pairing","subtitle":"Collaborative Tools for Distributed Development","authors":["Joe Kutner"],"publisher":"Pragmatic Programmers, LLC, The","published_date":"2013-12-17","description":"<p>You've heard about pair programming's benefits: fewer bugs, improved skills, and faster delivery. But what happens when you want to pair with someone in another city, country, or even hemisphere? With the right tools, you won't have to relocate to refactor. In this book, you'll learn techniques used by the most productive remote programmers in the industry to pair with anyone on the globe on any kind of project. You'll use collaborative editors, screen sharing, secure networking, and virtualization to create a remote pairing environment that feels as if your partner is sitting right next to you.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two heads are better than one, but only if they're working on the same problem. When pairing remotely, this requires a specialized environment that you'll learn how to create. We'll use the same open-source tools as the pros to improve collaboration and increase productivity. You'll learn techniques, patterns, and best practices you can apply to projects of all kinds. These tools are so effective that many co-located programmers use them despite sitting side-by-side--you don't have to work outside of an office for this book to improve your programming techniques.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We'll start by creating a secure collaborative editing environment capable of handling the low-bandwidth networks at some coffee shops. Then we'll share your screen using free open source tools and protocols. We'll deploy all of this to a server in the cloud so you can access your development environment from anywhere. Then we'll use one of the most advanced integrated development environments to collaborate, sketch on a virtual whiteboard, and resolve conflicts.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, we'll talk with programmers at Pivotal Labs, Big Nerd Ranch, and other top-notch distributed development firms to learn how they handle the challenges of remote pairing on a daily basis. With their help and advice, you can be productive from any location on the planet.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b>What You Need:</b>Many of the examples in this book require an internet connection. You'll only need one computer for most of the exercises, and you can run them by yourself. But havinga second computer and even a second person may improve the experience.</p>","isbn_10":"1937785742","isbn_13":"9781937785741","asin":"","page_count":108,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/3814/9781937785741_ae7fc53894a4409786eded021e198e47.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.685490Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.685514Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/FMipZIct91/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THoiPgyiz73P/remote-pairing"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2015-08-15","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2015-08-15T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.710348Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.772913Z","user_review":{"id":"PvzKj28","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/PvzKj28/","thoughts":"Good overview of technical side of remote pairing","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":108,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"6vLbPyN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/6vLbPyN/","book":{"id":"38GyeX5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/38GyeX5/","share_identifier":"kNq2u41UrV","slug":"understanding-comics-1","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THm1QLi5z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Understanding Comics","subtitle":"The Invisible Art","authors":["Scott McCloud"],"publisher":"Perfection Learning Corporation","published_date":"1994-05-17","description":"Praised throughout the cartoon industry by such luminaries as Art Spiegelman, Matt Groening, and Will Eisner, this innovative comic book provides a detailed look at the history, meaning, and art of comics and cartooning.","isbn_10":"1627652736","isbn_13":"9781627652735","asin":"","page_count":null,"binding":"Trade Cloth","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/55/9781627652735_ae798faf75134e8cb4cfad8928325219.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T17:22:15.597196Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T17:22:15.597221Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/kNq2u41UrV/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THm1QLi5z73P/understanding-comics-1"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2015-07-06","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2015-07-06T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.350208Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.427653Z","user_review":null,"page_count":null,"percent_complete":null},{"id":"g5R9P4N","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/g5R9P4N/","book":{"id":"q5gX7yv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/q5gX7yv/","share_identifier":"owtV0mh7R1","slug":"meanwhile-in-san-francisco","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THjA05Jqz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Meanwhile, in San Francisco","subtitle":"The City in Its Own Words","authors":["Wendy MacNaughton"],"publisher":"Chronicle Books LLC","published_date":"2014-03-18","description":"Take a stroll through the City by the Bay with renowned artist Wendy MacNaughton in this illustrated collection of everyday observations.

In his agonized search for absolute truth, Russell crosses paths with legendary thinkers like Gottlob Frege, David Hilbert, and Kurt Gödel, and finds a passionate student in the great Ludwig Wittgenstein. But his most ambitious goal—to establish unshakable logical foundations of mathematics—continues to loom before him. Through love and hate, peace and war, Russell persists in the dogged mission that threatens to claim both his career and his personal happiness, finally driving him to the brink of insanity. <p></p>This story is at the same time a historical novel and an accessible explication of some of the biggest ideas of mathematics and modern philosophy. With rich characterizations and expressive, atmospheric artwork, the book spins the pursuit of these ideas into a highly satisfying tale.  Probing and ingeniously layered, the book throws light on Russell’s inner struggles while setting them in the context of the timeless questions he spent his life trying to answer. At its heart, <i>Logicomix </i>is a story about the conflict between an ideal rationality and the unchanging, flawed fabric of reality.","isbn_10":"1596914521","isbn_13":"9781596914520","asin":"","page_count":347,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Kt1IngEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE72F3-B66ySvLE92hMkBOjFXcL7JfoVSUc7b6C5aeMLE63RwsHyJOS137l5E9Ow2mlRh91_0kjmILE8ipZtmj_dqTVODZBONGpdivJuWDYI6v2YFQWdRl6AW0BtHVA7oW__YQyEI&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-01-18T15:39:15.804156Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T15:39:16.139835Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/cetfsmLaYm/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/Kt1IngEACAAJ/logicomix"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2015-06-04","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2015-06-04T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.218011Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:36.300289Z","user_review":null,"page_count":347,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"Y8d0QZ8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/Y8d0QZ8/","book":{"id":"ZNBZRWN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/ZNBZRWN/","share_identifier":"sioyngaf78","slug":"manage-your-day-to-day","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THjLp5cqz73P","source_etag":"","title":"Manage Your Day-To-Day","subtitle":"Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus, and Sharpen Your Creative Mind","authors":["Scott Belsky (Foreword by)","Jocelyn K.

The result of thorough research, keen insight, and unassailable common sense, \"Good Calories, Bad Calories\" immediately stirred controversy and acclaim among academics, journalists, and writers alike. Michael Pollan heralded it as \"a vitally important book, destined to change the way we think about food.\" <BR>Building upon this critical work in \"Good Calories, Bad Calories\" and presenting fresh evidence for his claim, Taubes now revisits the urgent question of what's making us fat--and how we can change--in this exciting new book. Persuasive, straightforward, and practical, \"Why We Get Fat \"makes Taubes's crucial argument newly accessible to a wider audience. <BR>Taubes reveals the bad nutritional science of the last century, none more damaging or misguided than the \"calories-in, calories-out\" model of why we get fat, and the good science that has been ignored, especially regarding insulin's regulation of our fat tissue. He also answers the most persistent questions: Why are some people thin and others fat? What roles do exercise and genetics play in our weight? What foods should we eat, and what foods should we avoid? <BR>Packed with essential information and concluding with an easy-to-follow diet, \"Why We Get Fat \"is an invaluable key in our understanding of an international epidemic and a guide to what each of us can do about it. <P>\"From the Hardcover edition.\"","isbn_10":"1299154212","isbn_13":"9781299154216","asin":"","page_count":null,"binding":"E-Book","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/2447/9781299154216_6b704f0465a2495289d028283e2e0212.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:37.336313Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:37.336333Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/wEEgJv2W29/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THipfrkQz73P/why-we-get-fat"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2015-05-07","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2015-05-07T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:37.355440Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:37.404172Z","user_review":{"id":"Vv1bQA8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/Vv1bQA8/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":null,"percent_complete":null},{"id":"QNAVP05","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/QNAVP05/","book":{"id":"gNqmpdN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/gNqmpdN/","share_identifier":"jSjH736CSR","slug":"the-healthy-programmer","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THoiPgnPz73P","source_etag":"","title":"The Healthy Programmer","subtitle":"Get Fit, Feel Better, and Keep Coding","authors":["Joe Kutner"],"publisher":"Pragmatic Programmers, LLC, The","published_date":"2013-07-09","description":"<p><b>Printed in full color.</b><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To keep doing what you love, you need to maintain your own systems, not just the ones you write code for.

Tom DeMarco, a leading management consultant to both Fortune 500 and up-and-coming companies, reveals a counterintuitive principle that explains why efficiency efforts can slow a company down. That principle is the value of slack, the degree of freedom in a company that allows it to change. Implementing slack could be as simple as adding an assistant to a department and letting high-priced talent spend less time at the photocopier and more time making key decisions, or it could mean designing workloads that allow people room to think, innovate, and reinvent themselves. It means embracing risk, eliminating fear, and knowing when to go slow. Slack allows for change, fosters creativity, promotes quality, and, above all, produces growth.<br /> <br /> With an approach that works for new- and old-economy companies alike, this revolutionary handbook debunks commonly held assumptions about real-world management, and gives you and your company a brand-new model for achieving and maintaining true effectiveness.","isbn_10":"0767907698","isbn_13":"9780767907699","asin":"","page_count":256,"binding":"Trade Paper","cover_image_url":"https://cai.italictype.com/media/imgs/5976/9780767907699_007d8354f6394133942d48cd87acbfce.jpg","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-03-26T17:33:59.734951Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T17:33:59.734975Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/bPRjTxkami/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/0/1THdBxDTbz73P/slack"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2014-05-22","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2014-05-22T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:39.404809Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:39.466123Z","user_review":{"id":"gNqzlA5","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/gNqzlA5/","thoughts":"","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":256,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"q5g0Lav","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/q5g0Lav/","book":{"id":"BN92P95","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/BN92P95/","share_identifier":"hSKSB406uz","slug":"une-creativite-sans-limite","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THkm5ry8z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Une Créativité Sans Limite !","subtitle":"N'ayez Plus de Manque D'idées","authors":["Raphaël Lejoly"],"publisher":"Independently Published","published_date":"2017-09-05","description":"Vous avez déjà ressenti un manque d'idées, une perte d'idées ou la situation de la page blanche?Découvrez à travers ce livre une multitude de conseils afin de perfectionner votre créativité.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. <i>World War Z</i> is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.<br><br>Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. <br><br>Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, “By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?”<br><br>Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.<br><br><br>Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war<br><br>“I found 'Patient Zero' behind the locked door of an abandoned apartment across town. . . . His wrists and feet were bound with plastic packing twine. Although he'd rubbed off the skin around his bonds, there was no blood. There was also no blood on his other wounds. . . . He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls. At first the villagers tried to hold me back. They warned me not to touch him, that he was 'cursed.' I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy's skin was . . . cold and gray . . . I could find neither his heartbeat nor his pulse.” —Dr. Kwang Jingshu, Greater Chongqing, United Federation of China<br><br><br>“'Shock and Awe'? Perfect name. . . . But what if the enemy can't be shocked and awed? Not just won't, but biologically can't! That's what happened that day outside New York City, that's the failure that almost lost us the whole damn war. The fact that we couldn't shock and awe Zack boomeranged right back in our faces and actually allowed Zack to shock and awe us! They're not afraid! No matter what we do, no matter how many we kill, they will never, ever be afraid!” —Todd Wainio, former U.S. Army infantryman and veteran of the Battle of Yonkers<br><br><br>“Two hundred million zombies. Who can even visualize that type of number, let alone combat it? . . . For the first time in history, we faced an enemy that was actively waging total war. They had no limits of endurance. They would never negotiate, never surrender. They would fight until the very end because, unlike us, every single one of them, every second of every day, was devoted to consuming all life on Earth.” —General Travis D'Ambrosia, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe","isbn_10":"0307346609","isbn_13":"9780307346605","asin":"","page_count":354,"binding":"N/A","cover_image_url":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=oj2FDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&imgtk=AFLRE71RIqlFRBEkuzHCyoqo-uv6nfxT_DfXElwAEsGn_L2MJK5CEIjV7Y4TXc7T4YUWdhJSwBgfR8hauBAlKq1LhDTGd9E_T0Wog9KCPXhIqfE_g-jrkKn-2vl7cMSciTZ2BaCzC-59&source=gbs_api","language":"en","is_verified":true,"created_at":"2021-01-14T22:12:20.535174Z","updated_at":"2021-01-14T22:12:20.752211Z","add_book_url":"https://app.italictype.com/actions/book/KX9yqpNq8I/","book_detail_url":"https://app.italictype.com/books/1/oj2FDwAAQBAJ/world-war-z"},"book_queue":"38G2WvQ","display_state":2,"display_state_queue_name":"Completed","display_position":0,"label":"","current_page_number":0,"adjusted_page_count":null,"is_removed":false,"number_of_times_read":1,"track_by_percentage":false,"date_finished":"2010-01-19","started_reading_at":null,"finished_reading_at":"2010-01-19T12:00:00Z","restarted_reading_at":null,"paused_reading_at":null,"removed_at":null,"created_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:40.616036Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T18:58:40.671738Z","user_review":{"id":"E5JO4Yv","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/reviews/E5JO4Yv/","thoughts":"This book is a really good docu fiction about what would happens to earth if there is a zombie infection!<br/><br/>There are really good shorts stories about how it started and how they fought it!<br/><br/>The whole book is just about facts from people who lived that war!<br/>","rating":"5.0","review_tags":[]},"page_count":354,"percent_complete":0},{"id":"K8Oo7j8","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/bookqueueitems/K8Oo7j8/","book":{"id":"n84Q3KN","url":"https://www.italictype.com/api/books/n84Q3KN/","share_identifier":"68ZbUmaq16","slug":"ordinary-victories","source_name":"ItalicTypeCodex","source_uid":"1THkqjJ30z73P","source_etag":"","title":"Ordinary Victories","subtitle":"","authors":["Manu Larcenet (Illustrator)"],"publisher":"NBM Publishing Company","published_date":"2005-05-01","description":"This is the story of Marc, a photographer who's tired, of a very patient chick he meets, of banal horrors and of his pain-in-the-neck cat.
