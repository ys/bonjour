Whatever you do, get in the water on the first day of the year. 
If you can snap a few shots, even better.
We drove the camper around Brittany, spent a few days in Paris, but mostly stayed in Brittany.
It is still full of surprises. Friends coming and visiting, swimming, surfing, just good moments.
