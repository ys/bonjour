I really enjoy **telling stories and capturing moments of life.**
When I am not coding stuff at work or for myself, you'll probably find me brewing a cup of black coffee, learning how to surf, capturing moments on film or spending some quality time with the family.

We launched an amazing project with Clo√©. You should follow [@douarenn](https://instagram.com/douarenn) or visit [douarenn.fr](https://douarenn.fr). This is our cabin, disconnected from the internets in the middle of Finist√®re, in a place called "les Monts d'Arr√©e". [Book it now!](https://checkout.lodgify.com/douarenn/fr/#/475377/)

## Photography

Current gear:
- Leica M10-P
- [Leica M6](/leica-m6)
- A small Contax T3
- [Nikonos V](/nikonos-v) with a 35mm

I stopped thinking about home scans thanks to my great relationship with my beloved lab, [Mori](https://morifilmlab.com). It is way better to build relationship than skills. But hey, it is still somewhere, always.


## Surf

I started taking [pictures in the water](/nikonos-glaz) with some fins and a Nikonos. Salty water is my favorite kind of drug. I got my first longboard shaped by [Mimosa](https://mimosa-surfboards.com). It is a beauty. But I am still a kook. But at least a kook with a damn good looking board. I try to avoid Neoprene and prefer Yulex

## Coffee

I love a good cup of coffee. Using v60, Kalita or aeropress. My heart says stop but I keep drinking it. We got an espresso machine cause it is hard to get a good flat white around here but my latte art sucks.

## Writing

I am writing a [small letter in french](/bonjour) about all and nothing every two weeks. It is quite delightful. It forces me to write on a regular basis. I don't have many readers but they respond to those letters. So that makes me happy.

## Favorites

üì∑ ‚Üí Negatives get developed and scanned mostly by [Mori Film Lab](https://morifilmlab.com).

‚òïÔ∏è ‚Üí Most of my coffee beans comes from [Mok Coffee](https://mokcoffee.be) and [Terres de caf√©](https://terresdecafe.com). But I still like to try new roasters from time to time. Looking for suggestions

üñ® ‚Üí Prints come from [Ooblik](https://ooblik.com) & [N√©gatif+](https://negatifplus.com). I soldout [my first zine](/shop/a-thousand-tides) with [Ex Why Zed](https://exwhyzed.co.uk) but you can find other fun stuff I printed on the [shop](/shop).

## Social

I stick my pictures and some words kind of all over the web:

- [threads.com](https://threads.com/bonjouryannick)
- [glass.photo](https://glass.photo/yannick)

- [instagram.com](https://instagram.com/bonjouryannick)
- [vsco.co](https://vsco.co/bonjouryannick)

I might try even more cause I am getting bored of [Instagram](https://instagram.com/bonjouryannick).

You can find me writing short stuff on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@yannick) or [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@bonjouryannick).
