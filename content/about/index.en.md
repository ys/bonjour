<h2 style="padding-top:130px;padding-bottom:50px;">Welcome to Vadrouiles & Co.</h2>


Hello, I am a little adventures' photographer. Micro activist loving the outdoor. For me sharing is caring. Dad of a climber/adventurer to be. I do my best to share my values and make this planet a better place.

We left the city after 12 years to move to the country side of FinistÃ¨re and live slowly in the Monts d'ArrÃ©e.

We are discovering the region, its fauna and flora. and How to deal with a slow internet. We are growing vegetables, having chickens, a dog and a cat. We are enjoying this place as much as we can. Between land and sea, follow our adventures.

This big change and random inspiration allowed me to live a fully, simpler life. I was able to reconnect with nature. I will tell you all about my first axe cut and my new hobbies.

My goal is to inspire you by sharing moments of our simpler and more authentic life.

I hope that you will enjoy your time here. Don't hesitate to leave me a not. And **let's meet outdoors**
