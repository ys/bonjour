Hello, I am a little adventures' photographer. Micro activist loving the outdoor. For me sharing is caring.

We are living a simple live in FinistÃ¨re, Bretagne. A garden, chickens and some good times. A simpler live connected to mother Earth. We are fighting for our planet and taking care of her as much as we can.

My goal is to inspire you by sharing moments of our simpler and more authentic life.

I hope that you will enjoy your time here. Don't hesitate to leave me a not. And **let's meet outdoors**
