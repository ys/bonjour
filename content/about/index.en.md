Hello, I am Yannick.

I love to wander and discover tids and bits of nature. Close or far, I don't mind. Adventure can be lived next door or next continent. Looks like it is called micro adventure.
During our wandering, I am often with my camera, or should I say my cameras. I often am sharing those amazing times with my wife and kid.
 
I also enjoy good coffee. Black and early in the day. Hot or cold, I don't mind. I take it with me during our nights oustide. I might talk about this also.

We decided to move to Brittany, coming back to the country side. I wanna share that experience and life with y'all. Our activities, discoveries and adaptations.

I love our planet and decided to do my best to be kind with her.

Being outside is my therapy.
