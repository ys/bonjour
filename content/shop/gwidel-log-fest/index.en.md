This zine is about a longboard surf festival that happened in Guidel in May 2022.
I was shooting with my beloved Leica M6 and a Canon Prima AS1. So it is film only.
It is not about the action sport, more about the vibe and smiles you could find that day.

Shipping included 
But you probably can have a special price if you wanna meet me instead.
