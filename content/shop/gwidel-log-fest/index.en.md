This zine is about a longboard surf festival that happened in Guidel in May 2022.
It is only shoot with film cameras.

It is not about the action sport, more about the vibe and smiles you could find that day.

## Pre-order available soon

Shipping included 
But you probably can have a special price if you wanna meet me instead.
