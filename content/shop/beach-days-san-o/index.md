**Original print from the exhibition**

Beach Days is that mix of sand, wax and sun that we all crave every summer.  
It is part of my endless summer in California.  
I have documented our journeys from Santa Cruz to San Onofre and decided that part of that needed to be enjoyed as a printed thing.  
This is it.
