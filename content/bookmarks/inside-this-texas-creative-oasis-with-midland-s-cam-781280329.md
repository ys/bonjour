description: "Subscribe to Huckberry's YouTube: https://bit.ly/3QnVuLG\n\nOn this
  episode of Huckberry Homes, we drove out the Texas Hill Country to see our good
  friend Cameron Duddy. When he’s not touring around the world with his band Midland,
  you can find him out on his ranch, deep in the heart of Texas. Cameron gave us the
  lay of the land, showing us everything from a creative oasis he calls an office,
  to the places he enjoys most with family and friends.\n\nOn Huckberry Homes, we’ll
  be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an
  inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase
  everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and
  other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.\n\nLevel up your
