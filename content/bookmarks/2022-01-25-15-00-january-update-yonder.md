Many of you might know that Tom and I rode dirt bikes from Chile to California once upon a time. We took a year to do it, rented out our flat, sold a lot of possessions and lived cheap, camping most of the way up through South and Central America. We always swore we’d revisit some of the places we fell in love with and we would do it as a family. In February we are heading back to California to re-trace our steps south of the border into the Baja Peninsula of Mexico.

Baja is a 1200 mile long, thin peninsula south of San Diego with the Pacific Ocean to the West and the Sea of Cortez to the East. It’s largely a hostile, arid desert with remote waves littering coast, some of which are easier to access than others. The water’s cold, the roads are bad, the fuel is scarce but Baja is synonymous with the spirit of true adventure and has some incredible right hand point breaks.

We are going to work on a short film to document the journey and the process of adventure surf travel as a family that we can’t wait to share with you all in the Spring and when signal allows, we will try to offload some of the adventure onto Instagram when we can.

We will be back mid March and straight on with lessons, clubs, camps and some other exciting events and some longboard clinics.
