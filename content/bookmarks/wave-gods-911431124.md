description: "Log Rap presents Wave Gods brought to you by Ross Concepts. It's been
  a few months since we've posted a straight clip, but this one is sure to be an instant
  classic. The level of longboarding that Mencos, Augusto and Tedi are doing right
  now just feels like a breath of fresh air. Feels like each of these guys is pushing
  longboarding in a new direction while all remaining true to themselves. Happy to
  be able to link up with Ross and Matt to bring you guys some new surf porn.\n\nBoards
