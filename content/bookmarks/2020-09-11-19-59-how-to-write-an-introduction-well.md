This is page one of a guide to Writing Well. This page covers:

*   Finding the best ideas to write about—for blog posts, essays, and articles
*   Finding the most interesting direction to go in
*   Writing an intro that compels readers to continue reading

###### When writing, consider listening to atmospheric music. It may help reduce your susceptibility to distraction: a steady beat without vocals helps put you in a trance. Here's my [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/62zaWgEWM3DjoXygxhksmS?si=y_78EN__TNqhmCFfb79nUA).

What makes nonfiction good
--------------------------

People read nonfiction to learn and to feel. My framework for ensuring a blog post accomplishes both is to start with a first draft that focuses on "novel" ideas.

A novel idea is one that's not just new to the reader, but also significant and not easily intuited. Think of it as new and _worthwhile_. There are five novelty categories:

*   **Counter-intuitive** — "Oh, I never realized the world worked that way."
*   **Counter-narrative** — "Wow, that's not how I was told the world worked!"
*   **Shock and awe** — "That's crazy. I would have never believed it."
*   **Elegant articulations** — "Beautiful. I couldn't have said it better myself."
*   **Make someone feel seen** — "Yes! That's exactly how I feel!"

Novelty is what gives readers dopamine hits. You find novel ideas by pursuing your curiosity and noting what interests and surprises you along the way. If it intrigues you, it'll likely intrigue your readers too.

In drafts two and beyond, I then rewrite these novel ideas to make them _resonate_. Resonance is when ideas take root in readers' minds. It's the art of capturing their imaginations and relating to their life experiences so that they _feel_.

Ideas resonate when they're wrapped in:

*   Stories
*   Analogies
*   Examples
*   Authentic voice

In other words:

> Writing Quality = Novelty x Resonance

That's my writing framework.

And it starts with choosing your topic.

We write to clear our minds, reflect on our experiences, force ourselves to dive deeper, satisfy our curiosities, teach others, build reputation, and hone our craft.

But the best topic to write about is always the one you can’t _not_ write about. It’s the idea bouncing around your head that compels you to get to the bottom of it.

Sometimes, this means the ideal place to start is thinking through what bothers you most. Write a post to work through that—because the best writing is often therapy that you publish for the world to learn from.

Here's what that looks like in practice. Step one is choosing an **objective** for your post, such as:  

1.  Open people’s eyes by proving the status quo wrong. [Example](/blog/vanity-metrics).
2.  Share a solution to a tough problem. [Example](/blog/life-planning).
3.  Distill an overwhelming topic into something approachable. [Example](/blog/mental-model-examples).
4.  Tell a suspenseful and emotional story that imparts a lesson. [Example](/blog/storytelling).
5.  Articulate something everyone’s thinking about but no one is saying. Cut through the noise.
6.  Identify key trends on a topic. Then use them to predict the future.
7.  Contribute original insights to a field through your research and experimentation.  
    

Step two is pairing that objective with what **motivates** you:  

1.  Does writing this article get something off your chest?
2.  Does it help reason through a nagging, unsolved problem you have?
3.  Does it persuade others to do something you believe is important?
4.  Do you obsess over the topic and want others to geek out over it too?  
    

Your objective clarifies what you're trying to accomplish, and your motivation ensures you actually see it through.

That’s all that's needed to write with conviction: pair an objective with a motivation. When writers lack one of these, they tend to not finish their articles.

If the right objective and motivation combo isn't coming right away, that's okay. Start writing like you would in a diary to uncover what's in the back of your head. As you write, a clear objective will eventually emerge. At that time, do a full rewrite with your clear objective as your guiding light.

Once you've chosen what to write about, the next step is uncovering what to say.

My process begins with writing an intro because intros help me find novel ideas.

I define an intro as the minimal information necessary to:

*   Introduce the breadth of the post's contents so that readers can decide if it's for them.
*   Hook readers into reading more.  
    

It doesn’t matter how you hook readers, so long as you eventually fulfill the hook.  

A hook is not a gimmick. It’s a fundamental psychological principle: A great intro—like an electrifying opening to a film—buys goodwill with readers. Buy enough goodwill and readers look past the weaker parts of your post—because they're chasing the high from your great opening.

And, most intriguingly, the flipside of a hook is a novel idea you can write about. Let me show you what I mean.

### What is a hook?

A hook is a _half_\-told story. You raise a question then tease only part of the answer:  

*   **Questions** —Pose an intriguing question, but don’t give the full answer.
*   **Narratives** — Share the start of a narrative, but withhold the conclusion.
*   **Research** —  Highlight research findings, but only a small portion.
*   **Arguments** — Make an unexpected claim, but don't explain how it's true.  
    

Hooks serve two purposes: 

*   They compel readers to continue reading. They switch on the storytelling machinery in readers' heads.
*   They help you identify what's interesting—novel—to write about.

We don't need the answers to our hooks—yet. At this point, we're just trying to find the most interesting questions we can possibly pose that will get people to keep reading. Later, our hunt for answers will become our pursuit of novelty.

Let's look at three types of hooks.  

#### 1\. Narrative hooks

With a narrative hook, you share the beginning of a profound change in circumstances, but you withhold the conclusion.

Provide just enough details for readers to feel emotionally invested.

> My clothes turned to ice. I took them off and looked for a fresh pair—before realizing that I hadn't actually brought one.The pair I just removed took off with the wind and over the mountainside.I was now standing—bare—on an arctic summit. I had no way of avoiding full-body frostbite and death by hypothermia. It was 3 AM and there wasn't a soul within miles.
> 
> That was the day I lost everything. And this is the story of what happened next.

#### 2\. Research hooks

With a research hook, you highlight fascinating findings—but only a portion.

> I tracked all 90 living individuals who were born without the ability to sense pain. 80 of them are living normal lives by following strict day-to-day regimens.
> 
> The remaining 10, however, are defying everything we know about what it means to survive. They've led to the discovery of fascinating new drugs.

#### 3\. Argument hooks

With an argument hook, present a bold claim but withhold how you arrived at it.

> There's a 90% chance that Cloudtex goes bankrupt within thirty days. This post walks you through the startling corruption that triggered their downfall.

> There's a reliable technique for getting yourself to sit down and write—to completely break through procrastination every single time.

#### Asking a question isn't enough

For a hook to resonate, readers must be given enough context to care about the rest of the story.

Therefore, our intro must accomplish two things:

*   Give readers a reason to care about our hook. **Connect** it to **meaningful** problems they face. (Failing to do this is where most intros go wrong.)
*   Hook readers with half of an interesting story.

#### Hooks become talking points

When you identify a good hook, you've also identified a compelling idea to explore in the rest of your post.  

And that's the point: great hooks force you to write something novel.

If you can't find good hooks on your own, ask others what questions they most want answered on your topic. Find the answers then turn those into hooks.

##### Note that there are many ways to write. I'm sharing approaches that I find most reliable. There is no right or wrong way—only what works best for **you**.

### Are you bored right now?

If you don't care to learn about the ideation process, you can skip half this guide and continue at [Page III (Rewriting)](/guide/write/rewriting) for rapid fire advice on improving your writing.

While a hook pulls readers in, skepticism is what pushes them away.  

Skepticism often outweighs the strength of your hooks, causing readers to abandon your writing. But, you can do something about this.

In your intro, consider proactively countering any major skepticisms that exist. There are five types of skepticism to counter:  

*   **Superficial**: Superficial skepticism emerges from readers not believing you’ll share things they don’t already know.  
    _Solution_: Tease your original insights in your introduction.**‍**
*   **Irrelevant**: Readers don’t believe you’ll cover key points they care about.  
    _Solution_: List the points you’ll cover.**‍**
*   **Sloppy**: Readers don’t want to sit through bad writing.  
    _Solution_: Rewrite your intro to be clear, succinct, and intriguing.**‍**
*   **Implausible**: Readers don’t believe you’ll deliver on your hooks.  
    _Solution_: Include quotes from authorities who agree with you.
*   **Untrustworthy**: Readers don’t believe you're qualified to write about this.  
    _Solution_: If you have relevant credentials, share them. If not, make your hooks so captivating that they can't help but continue reading. Make the rest of your post so insightful, logical, and well-researched that they believe you. Or, if you're indeed unqualified, be upfront about it and frame the post as an exploratory journey you're taking them on.

If you successfully hook readers while neutralizing their skepticism, you generate goodwill: now they're invested in reading the rest of your post.

### Example of combatting skepticism

Below is the introduction to my Build Muscle handbook. I've indicated the passages used to address skepticism.

#### Intro

This handbook is the result of a year's research into what the latest science shows is the most efficient way to build muscle.

↑**Address the Untrustworthy objection: reassure readers you have the requisite wisdom to be authoratitive.**

It's for both men and women. It's primarily for beginners, but there's plenty of science-backed advice for intermediates too.

I wrote this guide because much of the casual weightlifting advice is unsubstantiated or misleading. I can't blame bloggers for it, because some of the facts in this guide have not been broadly published outside of the scientific literature. 

As a result, this handbook contradicts some popular bodybuilding recommendations, including the myth that women have a harder time gaining beginner muscle, that exercise rest times should be kept to 1–3 minutes, that most body weight exercises are useful, that machine exercises are ineffective, and so on.

Throughout this handbook, I support my claims by citing studies and showing you how to measure your weekly gains so you can confirm you're growing. 

Speaking of growth, if you're starting without muscle, you can grow it fast if you're diligent about eating, exercising, and sleeping. You can gain up to 12-15lbs (6.8kg) of muscle in 3 months when closely following a researched program such as this. (Afterward, muscle gains slow drastically.) 

↑ **Address the Superficial objection: reassure readers you’ll share new knowledge they don’t already have.**

In addition to thoroughly citing research, this guide is also comprehensive. I dislike tutorials that provide 75% of what you need to know then leave you with questions.

We'll learn what the research says about:  

*   How to eat to gain muscle mass.
*   The most effective exercise routines.
*   Measuring your weekly muscle gains.
*   Overcoming plateaus.

↑ **Address the Irrelevant objection: reassure readers you’ll cover topics they care about.**

Inspired? Good. If you weren't willing to spend 1–2 years in the gym to get results before now, be excited because you can compress beginner gains into 4 months.

Oh, and I have nothing to sell you. This handbook is free. There's no promotion.

↑ **Address the Implausible objection: reassure readers you can deliver on your claims. In this case, I use the truth that I'm not trying to sell them anything.**
