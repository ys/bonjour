description: |-
  Following in the footsteps of a thousand other travellers, Reef teamrider Mike Lay and  friends set off on the road west to Galicia. With a diverse range of surfboards and open minds to waves of various size and quality they explore the countless coves of north-west Spain, what it means to travel and whether it is the destination or the getting there that really matters.
