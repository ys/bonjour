description: "https://bit.ly/47bfNme | Huckberry delivers the best of adventure, style,
  and gear to your inbox 3 days a week. Sign up now. \n\nWe are thrilled to introduce
  our new series, Huckberry Homes.\n\nHere at Huckberry, we believe that style isn’t
  defined solely by what you wear — it’s personified in your morning rituals, your
  bookshelves and music library, the furniture you choose to spend your waking hours
  in, and the gear closet that powers your passions and pursuits. Style doesn’t end
  with your closet, it sparks to life there.\n\nOn Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping
  into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek
  into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from
  cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that
  inspire creativity and high-performing lives.\n\nFor our first entry, we turned
  to Austin, Texas’ own Scott Ballew. Our good buddy, Scott, is a filmmaker and songwriter
  who owns a Bohemian bungalow in the heart of Austin’s first suburb. It’s a home
  now that serves as a creative incubator, gathering place, hideaway, recording studio
  -- and maybe, as a personal shrine of a man curated by the man himself.\n\nCome
  get nosy with Huckberry Homes.\n\nhttps://bit.ly/3qebOVL  | Read more about Scott's
  home on the Huckberry Journal"

Texas has something unique and US houses too. A lot of minimalism just took us to soulless places...
