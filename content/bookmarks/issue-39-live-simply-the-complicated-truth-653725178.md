  Many aspects of our lives are intentionally slow. We have rejected the traditional path, the daily grind, the rat-race and instead opted to try and make a living doing things we love. We do not strive for material wealth, we strive for time in Nature. We live in a world of beauty and wonder, shaped by forces of unfathomable magnitude and we refuse to let society blind us to that fact.
  "Simplify your life. Don't waste the years struggling for things that are unimportant. Don't burden yourself with possessions. Keep your needs and wants simple and enjoy what you have. Don't destroy your peace of mind by looking back, worrying about the past. Live in the present. Simplify!" ~ Henry David Thoreau
