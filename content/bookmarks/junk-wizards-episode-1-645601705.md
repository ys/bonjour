description: "Heath and Addy stumble upon a junkyard in the South Australian bush
  and begin their search to find a ladder for the outdoor toilet they’re building
  back on the farm. They find their ladder – along with a truckload of other useful
  rubbish which they soon repurpose, building a solar oven and baking a solar-powered
  chocolate cake. \n\nSubscribe to the series on Roaring Journals: https://www.patagonia.com.au/farmboys\n\n0:00
