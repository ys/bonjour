description: "Head to https://www.nts-store.com/collections/bundles to grab all our
  publications at one discounted bundle price.\n\nHome to artist, maker and creator
  of youtube channel GET HANDS DIRTY Cristiana Felgueiras and her partner, this downtown
  Porto apartment has been meticulously handcrafted from scratch. Originally a small
  run down 70’s office space, adding custom built birch ply furniture and storage
  through-out has transformed it into fully equipped, personalised space that fits
  large musical instruments and other important objects. The airy and open living/sleeping
  area features a large built in floor to ceiling storage piece with a built-in sofa
  and integrated Murphy bed overhead. Other features include a custom double sided
  media console, a piano desk and a large wardrobe that doubles as a division and
  privacy wall between the entry way and the rest of the apartment. Every inch of
  this unique home is a reflection of thoughtful design within the constraints of
  limited space.\n\n\n#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign \n\nEps. 173\nProject

Small space and soooo creative. Low how it accomodates a non square place
