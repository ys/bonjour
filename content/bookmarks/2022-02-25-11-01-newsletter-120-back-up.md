Last week I tried to find a photo I made in the year 2000. 

It was a picture of the Empire State building taken from my dorm room window, and it was one of the very first digital photographs I ever made.

I checked all of the folders on my NAS. I thought I had everything I have ever made over the past twenty-two years on this thing. I keep impeccable records. But it wasn't where it should be. 

_By the way, lots of people ask me about my archive and backup situation. This is it. It's a [Synology DS1821+](https://amzn.to/3GY9BQn) with eight [10TB Iron Wolf](https://amzn.to/3rXs8rU) drives. This is what you should get. I am not available to help you set it up, that is what YouTube was invented for._

Anyway, this was driving me absolutely nuts. I couldn't do anything until I found the photo.

I went into my garage. I keep all the really old stuff in those plastic bins.

I used to back up everything I photographed to DVDs. Those were the good old days. I have hundreds of these things. The photo is almost definitely in here. The only problem is... I don't have a CD/DVD reader anymore.

Also in the garage are my original external hard drives, including my first [Netgear Ready NAS](https://amzn.to/3BwpDjm). Unfortunately, I didn't keep any of the cables to plug these in. Also, can you imagine how slow these will be. I cringe thinking about it.

I keep more of my modern-day backup hardware in the basement. The photo I am looking for is probably on one of the old Netgear NAS units (labeled B and C).

But of course, I'm not going to plug them in! I just wanted to come into the basement and stack a bunch of hard drives on top of each other so I could put this photo in the newsletter. This is basically just a photograph of digital waste. It's a sculpture that I call "Electronics I Am Too Scared To Throw Away So I Will Keep Them In My Basement Forever."

C'mon. I actually know exactly where the photo is. 

I upload all of my photos to the cloud.

This is a Google data center that I [photographed](https://datacentermurals.withgoogle.com/mayescounty) a few years ago.

I searched Google Photos for the year "2000" and found the photo within seconds.

There it is.

I should print this out.

Because prints will never get lost or become obsolete.
