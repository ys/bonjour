title: Using Playfulness as an Intuitive Compass - The Primal Revolution by Savannah
  Wishart
description: 'Gone surfing, be back never.Sitting on the beach overlooking Amado after
  my double session of surf, I couldn’t help laughing at where life has taken me.
  Or where I have taken life. Whichever it might be - probably a team effort, I suppose. As
  the sun slowly sunk closer to dunking itself like a glowing cookie into the Atlantic,
  I watched waves build, form, roll toward shore, and break. Small dots that were
  surfers watched, waited, and began paddling. Or they didn’t. Suddenly the ocean
  is something to analyze and understand. How is this wave different than the wave
  that came before? What made the surfer(s) paddle for this one? What were the cues
  they saw? Felt? I couldn’t help but to laugh at myself because never in my life
  had I felt much interest in surfing, and here I was: about a week into my travels
  with surfing guiding my every move. It made no logical sense, and that itself is
  a clue that this is the right direction.  No home, no anchor pulling me anywhere.
  Just me, my life compressed to fit in a backpack, my sense of self infused in the
  present moment, a playful curiosity, an openness to adapting as I gather information
  and meet people… Here is where I am, and this moment is all that I have. '
