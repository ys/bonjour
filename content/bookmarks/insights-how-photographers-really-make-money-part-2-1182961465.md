  I think the thing I worry about most is social media completely devaluing photography as an art form because it's so saturated. The brands I work with still need photos for social and paid advertising - they still need imagery that isn't film or motion. But everybody has a camera now. Which is fine, but I do worry about photography getting completely devalued and people losing sight of how an amazing image can convey meaning.
  The client is number one, but don't forget to be creative.
  put your work out there. The worst someone can say is no. But if you don’t even try, you’ll never know if they might have said yes
