title: 'Ray Barbee: A Common Thread - An ILFORD Inspires film'
domain: youtube.com
description: |-
  Ray Barbee's film ‘A COMMON THREAD’ is about finding enjoyment in things that are challenging. This is a captivating insight into a humble yet remarkably talented skateboarder, musician and photographer who believes that all 3 passions are crafted by various factors outside of the artist's control. From making prints in a darkroom to making music in a studio, Ray embraces the imperfections of analogue formats.

  Filmed and Edited by Exploredinary (Sarah Reyes and Daniel Driensky)

  Original Music by Richard Carpenter with Outro/End Credits Remix by Ray Barbee
