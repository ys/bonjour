title: '"James Barkman" - VW Van Life'
domain: youtube.com
description: "After cruising out to the West Coast from Pennsylvania in his VW Bus
  for a photography internship, James Barkman has set his sights on living on his
  own terms. For him this means perfecting his craft by hunting down photo-ops full
  time in his Westfalia with Surfboards on top and a Dual-Sport Motorcycle in tow.
  \n\n*DISCLAIMER: DO NOT CLIMB ON POWER LINE TOWERS. EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.\n\nJames,
  22, might not be as conventional when it comes to his living arrangements, but creating
  a space to be creative in the form of his Westfalia, has pushed him further than
  he ever thought he'd go.\n\nBalancing maintenance and repairs on the Westy with
  a promising career in photography are just a few of the many things the talented
  Mr. Barkman excels at, and we wish him the best of luck has he continues to grow
  on his journey.\n\n• Featuring the Photography of James Barkman • \nFollow along
