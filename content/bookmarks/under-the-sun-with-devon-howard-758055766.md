  Devon Howard and the word style are often used in the same sentence.

  Born and raised in San Diego, California, Devon has been a pivotal figure in the alternative craft scene since the late 90s, with his contributions to modern day midlength surfing being most notable.

  His effortless surfing has been featured in seminal counter culture surf films that include Thomas Campbell’s The Seedling and Sprout, as well as Jason Baffa’s Single Fin Yellow and One California Day.

  A few clicks north of where he grew up, Devon now resides in Ventura County where he splits his time between surfing, raising a young family, being a husband and designing and developing shapes for Channel Island Surfboards.
