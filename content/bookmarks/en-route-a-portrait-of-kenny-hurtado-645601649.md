title: 'EN ROUTE: A portrait of Kenny Hurtado'
domain: vimeo.com
description: |-
  As a staff photographer for SURFING Magazine, Kenny Hurtado quickly made a name for himself in the industry, thanks to his stylistic approach and innate talent for shooting classic surf imagery. It wasn’t until a trip to India opened his eyes to another side of photography and forced him to reevaluate his career path altogether. This film is about Kenny’s story and how he walked away from a dream job, in order to create a new photographic identity on his own terms.
