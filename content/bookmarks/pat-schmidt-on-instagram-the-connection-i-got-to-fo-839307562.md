title: 'Pat Schmidt on Instagram: "The connection I got to form with Andrew since
  moving to the east end is unexplainable. We always felt in sync. I felt like if
  he was on the beach I could surf a certain way that worked well with the way he
  wanted to capture images of surfing. I could see where he was moving on the rocks,
  know right away the shot he was trying to get and adjust my position accordingly.
  I’ve never had that before. I’ve never even wanted that before, but with Andrew
  it was different. I’m such a fan of his work that I wanted to do whatever I could
  to be a part of it. We had 5 days in a row earlier this summer that we passed each
  other on nappegue meadow in the same exact spot, both with middle fingers held high
  followed by a phone call cracking up about it that would end up lasting hours. I
  will miss those times but am so grateful to experience them. Love you Andrew, thanks
  for taking me under your wing. @blauschild"'
