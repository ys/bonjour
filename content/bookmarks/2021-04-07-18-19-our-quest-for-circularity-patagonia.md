Patagonia isn’t a stranger to secondhand. In 2011, we evolved our Common Threads Recycling Program into the Common Threads Initiative, an eBay store where customers could buy and sell used Patagonia products. That turned into [Worn Wear](https://wornwear.patagonia.com/) two years later and made it possible for customers to shop for used items in select stores. In 2017, Worn Wear went online, and since its launch, they’ve repaired more than 130,000 items, keeping them in play. But Worn Wear still only accounts for $5 million of our business. New products still reign supreme, and customers need more of an incentive to trade in their used goods.

We will soon test a rentals initiative, starting with a pilot for mountain biking, trail running, hiking and fly-fishing gear. Rather than buy a new set of waders, jackets and fleeces, customers can rent the clothes then send them back. The garments will be professionally cleaned so they can be rented again. Instead of having five brand-new jackets sourced, stitched and transported, there’s one jacket. And that’s a massive win considering our supply chain accounts for the biggest slice of our carbon footprint—97 percent with 86 percent stemming from raw materials alone.

Ultimately, the crux of circularity isn’t take-back programs, it’s rethinking how products are conceptualized to begin with.

“It has to be a core strategy of business,” says Nicole Bassett, Patagonia’s former social responsibility manager and now the cofounder of The Renewal Workshop, a platform that helps clothing brands achieve circularity. “Brands have to ask, ‘Where did this come from, and where will it go next?’”

In the past few years, Patagonia has prioritized recycled materials—like in its Responsibili-Tee®, a 100 percent recycled, [Fair Trade Certified™](https://www.patagonia.com/our-footprint/fair-trade.html) sewn T-shirt, each of which is made with 4.8 plastic bottles and 0.3 pounds of cotton scrap. It also uses 96 percent less water and generates 45 percent less CO2 than a conventional cotton T-shirt. On a larger scale, by this fall more than 90 percent of Patagonia’s fabrics will be recycled, organic and traceable.

The upcoming Tee-Cycle™ T-Shirt will be Patagonia’s first stab at designing a product with its full life cycle in mind. Due next spring, the zero-waste T-shirt will be made out of old T-shirts from Patagonia, or other brands. The point is for Patagonia to own all its waste across the lifespan of this tee, which is made from a blend of preconsumer mechanically recycled cotton and postconsumer chemically recycled cotton that creates like-new virgin fiber quality—and might never see a landfill.

The Capilene baselayers recycling experiment may not have panned out, but it taught us some lessons we’re implementing now. For starters, supply isn’t an issue. Right now, we have pallets upon pallets of old tees sitting in our Reno, Nevada, distribution facility. Unlike a technical product such as Capilene baselayers, tees have a shorter lifespan. And we also sell more of them.

There’s also a better handle on infrastructure this time around. We’ve partnered with Vertical Knits, a Mexico-based manufacturer that will own the entire creation process, from yarn to fabric to garment, and can control scrap collection. We also work with Infinited Fiber, a Finland-based recycling operation that can transform almost any waste—even cardboard—into new fiber.

That works for products with recycling channels in place, like there are for cotton and polyester and even certain blends, but not for technical products, many of which need special coatings, trims or fabrications to make them performance-level. Take DWR, which doesn’t yet have a sustainable alternative. Backpacks and waders still need waterproof coating.

“That’s what we’re wrestling with,” Cates says. “We make practical things that have to function, and if function is short-lived, people stop wearing it, and it’s trash. So how can we reimagine how we build products to meet those criteria?”

Cates hints at changes to luggage in the next year or so, as well as new options in rainwear, which is traditionally a polyester-based fabric with a polyurethane coating. It’s those sort of laminations that prevent products from getting recycled. So far, we’re experimenting with a polyester-based fabric _and_ coating so at the end of the product’s life, a polyester recycler will accept it.

That may get us closer to circularity on the material side of things, but what about emissions created when shipping the recycled cotton from Finland to Mexico, or the energy needed to actually make the products? Some garments have a significant footprint, especially those that are heavy, woven, made without any recycled materials or incorporate mechanical and chemical finishes to make them performance-level. Patagonia has invested in solar and wind options and currently we’re covering 100 percent of our US footprint through solar energy, but many of our supplier factories still run on fossil fuels. One solution is to work directly with suppliers to reduce their energy use and switch out fossil fuels.

“It’s difficult work that involves looking at the energy use on-site,” says Paul Hendricks, Patagonia’s senior manager of environmental responsibility. “Are there systems that can be upgraded to run more efficiently? Are there alternatives to coal, especially locally? And what is the willingness of a supplier to switch things out and potentially install new machinery?”

So if materials cause pollution and energy causes pollution, but a business still needs to provide products to the customer, the obvious (albeit, less capitalist) solution to getting closer to circularity seems to be: Make less stuff. Do we need a Better Sweater® 1/4-Zip in 18 colors?

“I’m of the mind where we need to trim down our line. Get rid of the most polluting products and go beyond massive assortment,” Hendricks says. “I come at it from the activist side. My role is to challenge things. Other people challenge _that,_ and hopefully we meet in the middle.”

Narrowing inventory would have big benefits—namely, less fabric liability, also called “deadstock.” Maybe a mill spun extra fabric to account for potential errors or shortages. Maybe an order was canceled or that ochre color wasn’t quite right. Whatever the reason, the more that’s produced, the more there’s excess waste that comes with it.

Capping products may sound like an ax to profit, but in a circular economy, it’s about generating more money from the same products and leaning into materials like recycled wool that are actually cheaper than their virgin counterparts.

“There’s a business model there,” Bassett says. “A brand is going to look like a car company, selling new, old, pre-owned certified. That’s how you’ll get scale, growth and profitability in a way that’s more efficient than continuously making new stuff.”

Even with our take-back programs, carbon positive goal and ongoing activism efforts, we admit we’re just starting the journey to circularity. We want our products back, but bigger questions remain.

“We need to work on being more aware of what’s going on in our full product life cycle,” Cates says. “Every product has an end of life, and from there, it’s our job to make new product out of it. That’s going to be the model going forward.
