description: "To experience Paperlike 2.1 for yourself head to https://paperlike.com/nevertoosmall\n
  \ \nSet in Tokyo’s Suginami-ku neighbourhood, home to many manga artists, Open Sky
  House is home to artists and architect Zajirogh, his wife, and their three children.
  Having always dreamed of living in a camper or a ship, Zaijrogh designed a large
  central open-air courtyard and covered it with a retractable sail-like sheet. The
  family uses the courtyard as a living room which is furnished with camping furniture
  that can get wet or be moved quickly if needed. A series of colourful walls line
  the courtyard, with precious items that need to stay dry kept behind a set of glass
  and steel sliding doors with another set connecting to the fully equipped L-shaped
  kitchen. The second story features space for the family to sleep, work and play
  and includes a 1sqm (small closet-sized) study that Zajirogh refers to as “his little
  sanctuary”. A door leading onto the balcony wraps around the open roof, this provides
  access to open and close the roof as well as an area for Zajirogh to paint freely
  without concern about mess.  \n\n#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign \n\nEp
