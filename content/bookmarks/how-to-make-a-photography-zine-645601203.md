title: How to Make a Photography Zine
domain: m.youtube.com
description: "This week I talk through how I made my zine \"America's Playground\"
  and the process of how to make a photography zine. Instead of the very literal process
  I instead talk about inspirations, subject, intent and how to print. \n\nThe first
  edition of this zine sold out two hours after I released it. Thank you so much to
  everyone who bought one. There will be more in the future :)\n\n////\n\nFollow Mattias
