title: The Ripple Effect
domain: vimeo.com
description: "At the start of the pandemic, Mike Guest found himself in an unusual
  setting: home. After 20 years of working as a freelance photographer in outdoor
  environments all over the world, he had been accustomed to constantly being on the
  move, surrounded by athletes, clients, collaborators â€“ and distractions.\n\nIt was
  during this period of personal darkness, and following a conversation with his friend
  and fellow surfer/photographer Nick Pumphrey, that Dawn Days was born. Every morning,
  Mike was up at 3.30am, pulling on his wetsuit and walking down to the beach with
  his camera, where he would swim out and capture the dawn.\n\nThe Ripple Effect is
  a beautifully open and honest reflection from Mike on how this project helped him
  process his mental health over the pandemic. \n\n\nUnderwater Footage by Mike Guest
