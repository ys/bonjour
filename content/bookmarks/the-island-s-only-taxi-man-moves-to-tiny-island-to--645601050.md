title: THE ISLAND'S ONLY TAXI - Man Moves To Tiny Island To SLOW DOWN
domain: youtube.com
description: "Eigg is a small island off the coast of Scotland, populated mostly by
  sheep, the dogs that keep track of them, and the 109 local residents.\n\nYou wouldn't
  think that such a small island would have need for a taxi service, but you'll be
  surprised!  Charlie is the only taxi on the island.  He moved here looking to find
  a slower way of life, and a community who place greater value on relationships and
  conversation than they do on their mobile phones.\n\n\"Sometimes I think there's
  too much technology involved in life.  It's not real - you're not meeting people,
  you're not grabbing their hand and shaking it.  We're losing that power -  the art
  of conversation.\" - Charlie Galli\n\nTo be part of our film making journey : https://www.patreon.com/greenrenaissance
