In the wake of 2020, after much reflection, we’ve decided to evolve Another Escape. Instead of producing a biannual publication, we’ll be publishing a book and launching a podcast in 2021 alongside complementary digital content. With our refocussed mission (read below) and our ambition to create more impact, we want our content to have greater reach, greater accessibility and more permanence and legacy. This is why we’ve chosen these mediums. We’re still figuring out the path ahead, but are super thankful for your support on our journey so far and hope that you’ll be along for the ride as we head into this exciting new chapter.

**The Long Read:**
