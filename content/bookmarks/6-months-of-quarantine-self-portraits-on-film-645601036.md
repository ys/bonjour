title: 6 Months of Quarantine Self-Portraits on film
domain: youtube.com
description: |-
  As quarantine set in back in March, Joe was really down. So, to get out of the funk, he started a daily self-portrait project with his daughter, Lena. He originally thought it would only be a few weeks, but that has now morphed into a 6 months with no end in sight. He takes a few minutes to look back on the project and then documents making one day's photo.
