description: As Heard on Midnight Chats Pt. 108
---

Brothers David and Stephen Dewaele make music and art under a host of names, from Soulwax to 2ManyDJs to DEEWEE.

I spoke to them for this week’s podcast episode about their HQ in the medieval city of Ghent, the high times of 2ManyDJs, their Soulwax documentary _Part of the Weekend Never Dies_, and how they never fitted in in Ibiza, even when playing Manumission.

Listen below or via your podcast app.

And then revisit _As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2_. It still bangs. As does the brothers’ new, first DEEWEE comp, _Foundations_.
