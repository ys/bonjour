A podcast for the renewable energy uprising.

Renewable energy rebels across Europe are rising up to put power in the hands of the people—and we’ve got a direct line to the heart of the movement. Join journalist and activist Lucy Siegle as she exposes our addiction to fossil fuels and its relationship to war, fuel poverty, and the Arctic being 70 degrees hotter than it should be. Peppered with explanations and details that will boost your energy literacy, season two of the We the Power series features inspiring stories from the frontline of change as communities across Europe sever links with dirty power. It’s time to join them and embrace community energy—our future depends on it.
