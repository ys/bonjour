  building, the home of Paris-based interior and product designer Adrien Dupuy is
  a compact, functional living space inspired by van life and his travels. Dupuy completely
  stripped the apartment, creating a 100% plywood joinery unit that cleverly houses
  the kitchen, bathroom, and mezzanine bedroom. The design maximizes every inch of
  space, with thoughtful details tailored to his lifestyle, including designated spots
  for his motorcycle helmets. Dupuy carefully selected a few designer furniture and
  lighting pieces to keep the apartment easy to clean, opting for a refurbished coffee
  table with a yellow glass top that matches the shower and California blinds for
  their '70s motel vibe.\n \n#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign \n\nEp
