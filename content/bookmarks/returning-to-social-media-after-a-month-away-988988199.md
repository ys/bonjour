title: Returning to Social Media after a month away.
domain: sethhughes.substack.com
description: I ended 2024 listening to Cal Newport’s book “Digital Minimalism.” It’s
  a book speaking on the importance of solitude and how, in the modern world, endless
  entertainment in our pockets means we never have to have a second alone with our
  thoughts if we don’t want to.
