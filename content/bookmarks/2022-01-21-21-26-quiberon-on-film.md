When the closest beach to your home is on the North Sea, you get used to surfing weak cold ass waves, in choppy conditions. You get a different definition of « long period swell » and « clean surf » than any other surfer.  
Of course, you have to seize every opportunity you get of surfing what other surfers would call « real waves ».

Last week’s forecast was a gem in Southern Brittany and Dimitri Pierzchlewicz took off from Northern France and drove to Quiberon to enjoy these few days of clean long period swell. He also packed a bunch of waterproof and weather resistant film cameras recently acquired and tried them out over there.Some of these cameras seem to have focusing issues, but the photos are cool and we wanted to share them here.
