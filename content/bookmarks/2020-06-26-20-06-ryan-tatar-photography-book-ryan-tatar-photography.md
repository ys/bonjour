The Refueled ONE Series is one single subject, photographer, craftsman or artist. A modern take on the printed paraphernalia of publisher Chris Brown's youth. The faded pages and colors of LIFE magazine. The satirical tone of MAD. The low-fi quality of comics. The rebellious feel of the 60’s and early 70’s. The size of vintage scout manuals and Stuckey’s road trip souvenir activity books.

From Ryan:  
I made a small and limited release book with Refueled magazine’s publisher Chris Brown [@refueledmagazine](https://www.instagram.com/refueledmagazine/) showcasing my film photography over the past 15 years documenting a re-emerging DIY counter culture in surfing and boondocking the deserts of the American West. The work contains a variety of techniques such as psychedelic infused colors from cross processed slide film, to exposing 35mm negatives onto Polaroid film, shooting Mavericks with a 1960s era Polaroid Land Camera, 1960s era Nikonos II photos before anyone remembered what one was in 2003, and my latest work with a Leica M6 on the dusty trails of the High Sierra and Mojave desert seeking solitude and secret swimming holes. 6”x 9” softbound, matte [#70](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/70/) stock, 105gsm. Pick up a copy below or at www.refueledmagazine.com. My publisher Chris Brown has been exploring works in Americana for years and his work has been featured on a Netflix documentary and TED Talks recently... stoked to do a small project with him. 🤙🏼 🤙🏼 🏄🏼 ⛺️
