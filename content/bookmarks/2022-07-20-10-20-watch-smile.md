There is nothing worse than meeting someone you really admire and them turning out to be a shitty person. People can have such an inviting online presence but when you meet them you quickly find out that it’s part of an act. The point of this rant is to say that [Karl Berglind](https://www.instagram.com/karlberglind/) is the furthest thing from that. Not only is Karl an insanely talented skater, he is also one of the most humble dudes out. One of the first things I noticed about rolling up to a park with Karl is that he takes the time to talk to everyone. His skating and attitude are infectious and it radiates around him. Always smiling and always ripping, Karl’s approach to skating is uniquely his own. _—[Matt Trainor](https://www.instagram.com/mattrainor/?hl=en)_
