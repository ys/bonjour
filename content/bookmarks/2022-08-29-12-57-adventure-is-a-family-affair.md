We flew to LAX, stayed with some good friends in the OC and trawled the internet for used trucks. We found a 2000 Tacoma, it was the second one we went to see; it had a truck cap, good tires, ran well, AC, nice paint. Our good friend Otto from the Temecula based motorcycle company Biltwell was our Californian consultant; he knows a thing or two about Toyotas, Adventures and Baja. The truck felt right, we trusted the family selling it. We looked them in the eye, as a young family putting it all on the line for this trip and we asked them if they would buy this truck for the journey we planned. They looked us back in the eye and said they would; so we shook hands and gave them all our savings.

We took it to our friends Rob and Traceyâ€™s up in the hills East of LA and DIY built a bed, some storage and raided their workshop for fluids and camp gear. Otto hooked us up with tools; compressors, starter kit, plug kit, tow ropes, jack etc and set us on our way. Boards loaded on the roof bars, Billy crammed in the back, roof box full of UHT Oat Milk, wetsuits and tools - we were ready for the desert.
