description: "Farm Boys heads east to Bass Strait and drops in at Addy's place on
  the remote Furneaux Islands, where he's managed to grow tropical fruit a few degrees
  north of the cold Roaring Forties. He shows us around his off-grid house, including
  his saltbush patch, his wombats, and his surfboard collection, featuring boards
  he's made himself entirely from discarded island junk.\n \nSubscribe to the series
