**Interview with Gaëtan Duke**  
by Abel Ibáñez G.

**What camera and other tools did you use to shoot this photograph?**  
Pentax MX with 35mm lens.

**Tell us about the place and time when this photograph was taken. What were you doing there that day?**  
This photo was shot a couple years back while I was travelling in Australia. This day we drove for hours looking for a safe spot to stay for the night as bushfires was ragging all around the area. When we found this little bay, all we wanted was to rest and enjoy the sea for a little while.

**What do you like the most about this photograph and why?**  
I like the tones on this photo. As soon as I got this roll back from the lab I knew it has something special with those strange tones, as if it was an old holiday picture taken by your grandparents. The entire roll also had vertical scratches due to sand stuck inside my camera body. For some reason I feel like it had a little something to the photo.

**Was there anything that you can consider an influence or source of inspiration to create this photo?**  
I’m shooting and filming a lot of surfing action for work. When I do, I love to find spots where I can shoot from the side to highlight the shape of the waves. In a way, I think I shot this picture with the same process.

**Tell us something fun, interesting, weird or intense that happened at any point during the process of making this photo.**  
When we board the plane to fly to Australia this year, huge bushfires started devastating the country at the same time. For the next two months, we travelled through devastated lands, and we always had to find itineraries avoiding the most unsafe areas. It was heart-breaking to see a country that you love burn into ashes, and even though we did our best to try to help, it felt weird to try to have good times and to document our travels.

Because of the bushfire smokes, all the colours of my photos turned out unique with grey/orange moods and skies what definitely added something different to them.

**For this photo, did you do something completely different to what you normally do for other photos?**  
No, I was just, as usual, carrying my camera around, and this set up came up in front of me. Just had to push the button.

**Where and in which format would you like this photo to be exhibited?**  
Would love to see this photo printed in a little book or zine about my travels. I’ve got to work on it!
