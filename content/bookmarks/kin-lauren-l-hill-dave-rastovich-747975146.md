description: "“All of life – each breath, every sip – is an inheritance from those
  who came before.” Like many Australian families, the ocean is where Lauren L. Hill
  and Dave Rastovich’s family connect – through surf and play. \n\nJust a few generations
  ago, the ocean was considered too big to fail. Now with so many threats, the ocean
  seems too big to fix. In search of solutions, Lauren and her family travel to Lord
  Howe Island Marine Park, one of Australia's most protected marine sanctuaries. \n\nKIN
  is a story of the ocean, love and connection. It’s about the world we’ve inherited,
  the choices we can make, and what it looks like when we get things right. \n\nProtect
  Australia’s ocean for good. Sign the petition now at https://www.patagonia.com.au/oceans
