title: Days Well Wasted
domain: youtu.be
description: |-
  Remember when the sign of a good day consisted of birds chirping in the morning, the smell of coffee brewing, and fresh dew on the grass? Yeah, maybe that seems cool when you’re in middle school… Or retirement. Fuck that, wanna know what’s way more fun? Waking up to snow on the mountain, swell in the water, and solid skate spots—and of course the ever-comforting sound of beers cracking all day long. That’s precisely why we hit up 3 of our favorite humans to absolutely waste a few days snowboarding, surfing, skating, and crushing beers faster than we ever thought possible. And as we learned, a day well wasted is often a day well spent.

  Featuring Dan Plunkett, Scott Blum, and Jake Kelly. Video by Chad Huff. Music by No Age and Grady Strange.
