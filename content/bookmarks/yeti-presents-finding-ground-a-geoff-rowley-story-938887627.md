title: 'YETI Presents: Finding Ground: A Geoff Rowley Story'
domain: youtube.com
description: "From 12-year-old boy with his first skateboard in Liverpool to 43-year-old
  professional skater and hunting guide in California, Geoff Rowley is anything but
  typical. Which is why it comes as no surprise that to stay fit, he now spends weeks
  at a time deep in the California wilderness in search of Desert Big Horn Sheep.
  For a man who has spent his life doing tricks in the air, hunting is now the way
  he stays grounded and finds the inner peace to live happy. \n\nSubscribe to the
