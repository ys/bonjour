When our bodies are stressed or we sense a threat, we experience the fight-flight-freeze response, a heightened state of arousal. Our brain will process signals of stress in the amygdala, a part of the brain that evolution has designed to primarily process emotions associated with fear. The hypothalamus, the ‘command centre’ of the brain receives a signal to say you are under attack, stimulating a release of cortisol and adrenaline. This response, passed down from our ancestors puts our bodies into a state of acute stress. The same stress response happens when we enter the water. Your heart rate and breathing will increase rapidly, delivering the energy and oxygen needed to provide the elements you need to either ‘fight, fly or freeze’.

Unlike our ancestors, we’re not likely to be under attack from a lion, we’re just entering cold water. Depending on how acclimatised you are, it can take up to 10 minutes to adapt and regulate your breathing. Regularly entering cold water induces the hormone response a lot more, this response is the first stage to adaption. When we swim, we burn the cortisol up and produce endorphins which result in a feeling of wellbeing once we are back on dry land. It is as though our nervous system literally chills out.

Touch is something we associate with emotional closeness. This is significant not just in the landscape of our minds, but in our bodies too.
