description: Beginning your day in the ocean surfing is one of the best ways to start
  the day on the right foot. It can lead to increased mood, focus, and energy throughout
  the rest of the day. Additionally, being in the ocean is a meditative experience
  that can help rest your brain before the stress of work begins. We love surfing
