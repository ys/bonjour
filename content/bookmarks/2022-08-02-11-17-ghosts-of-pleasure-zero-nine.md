# Ghosts of pleasure — ZERO.NINE

> I lay there in bed and I said, ‘Sorry’, to my body, my lungs, my muscles, my bones and my heart. And I quietly said to myself, ‘You know, I'm going to do us a favour’, I said, ‘I'm going to stop putting poisons in our body’. And I say our body because I believe your body is shared. It felt really cool, you know, to just to just lay there and just go, ‘Wow, what a beautiful thing life has been’.
