title: The Punk Rock Garden - Episode 6
domain: youtube.com
description: "They say the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, and Heath Joske definitely
  reflects the hard-working, down-to-earth values of his parents. From Jenny Joske’s
  ‘punk rock garden’, to Paul Joske’s open-minded surf quiver, Heath’s folks have
  had a huge influence on his life today, which is spent evenly between the garden
  and the waves. This Farm Boys origin story travels back to Heath’s hometown of Valla,
  to see where it all began.\n\nSubscribe to the series on Roaring Journals: https://www.patagonia.com.au/farmboys\n\n0:00
