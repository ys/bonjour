# Busyness Decoded: How to Limit What You Say "Yes" To

1. Avoid behaviors that exacerbate your suffering or put you in situations where self-sabotage is inevitable.
2. Refrain from harming yourself, including negative self-talk and self-deprecation.
3. Reach out to others and fill in your self-care gaps with care from external sources.
4. Practice noticing the sources of your self-sabotage and disempowerment.
5. Connect with others who reclaim their power and change their behavior.
6. Build an “agency emergency plan” so you know what resources you have access to shift your mood, relieve suffering, or find some peace.
