You might have already heard of a 10x engineer. Probably too often, actually. If there's such a thing as a 10x engineer, surely there must be a 1x engineer, too?

Of course there is! Let's dig into a non-exhaustive list of what qualities make up a 1x engineer.

*   Searches Google, Duckduckgo, Bing, or wherever they like when they're not sure what's up.
*   Copy/pastes code snippets from Stack Overflow, Glitch, Codepen, or wherever they find answers.
*   Gives credit where credit is due.
*   Creates community and shares knowledge.
*   Spends time on things outside of engineering, like hobbies, friends, and family.
*   Has a schedule that allows them to maintain a healthy work-life balance, and respects others' time-boundaries, too.
*   Isn't measured by arbitrary contribution scores on any website, and doesn't judge others for theirs either.
*   Writes code that
    
    &emdash;
    
    _gasp_ &emdash; has bugs.
*   Writes code that others can read.
*   Reads the Docs.
*   Updates the Docs.
*   Doesn't need to be passionate about the code they write or the problems they solve, but may be.
*   Doesn't act surprised when someone doesnâ€™t know something.
*   Is willing and able to collaborate with others.
*   Willing to spend time and energy to help teammates get unstuck, when appropriate.
*   Publicly celebrates others for their wins.
*   Ask questions before providing critical feedback.
*   Gives tough feedback privately.
*   Treats others how _they_ would like to be treated.
*   Provides code reviews and feedback to their peers that are constructive, helpful, and presented tactfully, helping their peers to grow personally and professionally.
*   Expresses appreciation for code reviews and feedback from their peers that are constructive and helpful.
*   Sometimes feels hurt by critical feedback, but doesn't react destructively.
*   Sometimes takes short breaks to clear their head.
*   Makes mistakes from time to time, and finds growth in those mistakes.
*   Willing to admit when they're wrong, and aren't afraid to say "I don't know."
*   May or may not like writing documentation, but does it anyway for future maintainers.
*   May or may not like writing tests, but tries to learn to do so if the team or project needs it.
*   Thanks others for their time, effort, and energy.
*   Can have colorful desktop backgrounds.
*   Supports code in production, even if they did not write it.
*   Can feel like an imposter at times, and understands others may, too.
*   Believes that everyone in the room is equally as smart and capable as they are.
*   Will help level-up others, and asks for help when they need it.
*   Never stops learning, but can feel totally overwhelmed by the amount of learning there is to do.
*   Tries to keep discussions productive and lets others have their say before the team makes a decision.
*   Is willing to leave their comfort zone.
*   Contributes to the community in their own way when possible, and appreciates the ways that others contribute when they can.
*   Can be a slow coder.
*   Has productive and unproductive days.
*   Doesn't take themselves too seriously.
*   Says, "I've never heard of that," in lieu of nodding and pretending.
*   Is trustworthy.
*   Works to live, rather than living to work.
*   Sometimes loses their work.
*   Doesn't have to have the entire codebase memorized.
*   Respects and upholds community Codes of Conduct.
*   May work from home, the office, a coffee shop, or where ever else best works for them.
*   Doesn't hate on tools, processes, or languages that they'd rather not use, or that others are using.
*   Is not defined by the computer they're using.
*   May decorate their laptop and workspace in any way they like, and is respectful of others' decor (or lack thereof), too.
*   Isn't defined by myopic Tweetstorms by clueless VCs.
*   May have a lot of unfinished personal projects, or no personal projects at all.
*   Doesn't riddicule entire professions within engineering, especially not when in a position of leadership.
