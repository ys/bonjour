title: These Hands Are Made For Making - Thomas Campbell
domain: youtube.com
description: |-
  The word legend gets thrown around a lot these days, but in Thomas Campbell’s case it’s entirely justified. Filmmaker, photographer, artist, writer, painter, sculptor, surfer, skater, Thomas is a master of many traits. Desillusion spent a day with Thomas in his hometown of Santa Cruz, to discuss his influences, his meticulous approach to his craft and why creating with your hands is so important.

  Supported by Element

  This short film is based on the article "Make Yourself Hard To Find" published in 50 Desillusion Magazine, Volume 2
