title: Magic Tricks With Skateboard Wizard Richie Jackson | SKATE TALES
domain: youtube.com
description: "@RichieJacksonFC is skateboarding’s last true outlaw. The Death Skateboards
  pro broke the skateboarding mould and threw its unwritten rule book in the bin,
  personally ushering in the ‘anything goes’ era everyone claims to applaud today.\n\nWith
  a wild imagination and inventive approach to what street skateboarding can be, the
  New Zealander has eclipsed most of his peers in terms of public awareness by using
  social media to leapfrog out of skateboarding’s orthodoxies. Holder of the most-watched
  video part in Thrasher’s history and possessor of unique personal style, Madars
  investigates the man from straight out of skating’s leftfield! \n\n#skateboarding
