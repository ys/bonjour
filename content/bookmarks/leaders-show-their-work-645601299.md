title: Leaders show their work
domain: ben.balter.com
description: Absent working within systems that naturally capture and expose process,
  transparency takes effort. Leaders should hold one another accountable for spending
  the additional cycles to show their work through communicating not only what decision
  was made, but also how the decision was made, and why.
