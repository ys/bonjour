  3 on Red Bull TV \U0001F4FAhttps://win.gs/3qsOZNC \n\nWes Kremer is your favourite
  skateboarder’s ACTUAL favourite skateboarder: an offline enigma who manages to be
  both one of the world’s most highly- rated and least visible pro’s at the same time.
  One of the purest souls in skateboarding, the San Diego native and former Thrasher
  Magazine Skater Of The Year might be expected to chase the benefits of the attention
  economy.\n\nInstead, Wes does not exist on social media at all- preferring to live
  a life of relative anonymity committed to the tour van and the everyman aspect of
  skateboarding life. The most elusive skate hero of the digital age, Madars sets
  out to discover how Wes juggles sponsorship responsibilities with a skateboarding
  career devoted to avoiding any unnecessary limelight. Join Madars as he kicks it
  with the unique Wes Kremer!\n\n#weskremer #skatetales #skateboarding \n\n► Subscribe
