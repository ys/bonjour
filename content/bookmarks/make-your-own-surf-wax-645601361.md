title: make your own surf wax
domain: langbrett.com
description: 'commercial surf waxes often contain toxic and environmentally harmful
  ingredients, e.g. paraffin, which is based on petroleum. during every surf session,
  the paraffin on your surfboard ends up directly in the sea. that''s why we make
  our wax from a mixture of natural materials: beeswax, canola oil and tree resin.
  it smells even better, sticks just as well as commercial surf wax and is environmentally
  friendly. and the best thing is, you don''t need much, and you can make your own
  wax on site in the camper.    recipe:    1/5 tree resin1/5 canola oil3/5 beeswax'
