Writing is the act of thinking clearly with the help of paper. Writing slows down your thinking so you can play with your ideas.

This handbook helps you write _nonfiction_ books and blogs for three reasons:

### 1\. Leverage

Writing is one of the most radical things you can do without money. Skilled writers change the world from their couch. One writer reaches millions.

Keeping thoughts to yourself is a disservice to the world. If you have something important to say and you say it well, you send strangers down paths badly needed.

### 2\. Clarity of thought

Writing is a laxative for the mind. When you write, your brain can't help but to draw connections between ideas and explore their implications. This shines light on broken logic, which helps you gain clarity of thought.

### 3\. Human connection

The most efficient way to meet interesting people is to become someone they already want to meet.

Do that by pursuing interesting things and writing about them publicly. Writing is a bat signal. When you write publicly with an authentic voice, like-minded people want to meet the person behind that voice.

What you'll learn
-----------------

Together, we'll deconstruct a topic you want to write about. Across five lessons, you'll learn to be more interesting, substantitive, and resonant:

*   **Page 1: Ideas** — Identify what to write about
*   **Page 2: First Drafts** — Generate insights for your topic
*   **Page 3: Rewriting** — Rewrite for clarity, intrigue, and succinctness
*   **Page 4: Style** — Rewrite for style and flow
*   **Page 5: Practicing** — Iterate toward mastery

##### See the bottom of your screen for quick navigation links.

I’ll provide a cheatsheet on the last page of this handbook, but I recommend taking notes. Reading educational content without notetaking is like exploring new territory without drawing a map. Help your brain make connections between ideas.

### Who should read this?

This handbook is for:

1.  **Advanced nonfiction writers** wanting to improve their craft: You’ll learn unique insights to better understand how exceptional writing happens.
2.  **Aspiring writers** who fear publishing online: This handbook could help increase your confidence. We'll overcome blockers together.

Over the next thirty minutes, you'll become a more deliberate writer who understands why they're writing what they're writing. There's science to nonfiction that I feel many have overlooked.
