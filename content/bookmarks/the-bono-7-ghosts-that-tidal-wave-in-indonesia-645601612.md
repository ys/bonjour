title: THE BONO "7 GHOSTS" thAt TiDAL wAve iN iNdOnESiA
domain: youtube.com
description: "A bucket list surf adventure to a tidal phenomenon that occurs in the
  Kampar River known as the Bono \"7 Ghosts\". I have always wanted to check this
  place out ever since I saw Rip Curls \"Search\" edit on this wave that they released
  in 2011. In this video I break my whole experience down, from what I learn about
  the Bono, to the locals who surf it, to even a little behind the scenes of the iconic
  \"Search\" trip in 2011. Everything about this video is what keeps me out there
  filming and surfing these amazing wonders of the world we are so lucky to witness.
  Hit me with any comments and questions on what you think of the trip :) \n\nTerima
