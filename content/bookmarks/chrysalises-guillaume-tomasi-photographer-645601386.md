description: Where did the butterflies go? This ordinary sentence was the starting
  point of this work. Pronounced distinctly by my two-year-old son during his restless
  sleep because of a heavy night fever, these few words triggered on me a long reflection
  on how we protect our children from the world. This reassuring cocoon, but unfortunately
  precarious, is inevitably meant to be broken by the hazards of life. Following these
  events of misfortune, our perception of the world is altered and we are forced to
  grow up, to get ourselves back together or to look at things through a new perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Chrysalises presents anonymous stories about intimate events that changed peopleâ€™s
  worldview. These events, transcribed as anecdotes, coexist with visual interpretations
  of suspended moments where the mundane seems to have shifted in a slightly different
  direction.
