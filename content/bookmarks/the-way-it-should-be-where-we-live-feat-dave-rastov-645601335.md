description: "See the full story: http://www.stoneandwood.com.au/where-we-live/\n\nWe’re
  all visitors…\n\nProfiling passionate people who've gravitated to the Northern Rivers
  for a more conscious lifestyle, The Way It Should Be series tells the stories of
  locals and their connection to our community, the environment and their craft.\n\nOur
  latest video, featuring coastal custodian Dave Rastovich, reminds us that we are
  all visitors on this Earth and so we have a collective responsibility. \n\nRasta’s
  message is that by being conscious and treading lightly, we can move forward as
  individuals, as conscious businesses and as communities.\n\nWe’re so lucky to call
  the Northern Rivers home and we hope you can share the stoke and be inspired by
  this special place and its people too.\n\nDirector / DOP / Edit: Cape Productions
  / Pete Rogers\nMusic: Cotton Jones \"Somehow to keep it going\"\nSound Mix: Jordan
  T Power\nColorist: Tim Wreyford\nAdditional Footage: Nathan Oldfield, Rob Sherwood"
