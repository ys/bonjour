description: "Fin de service with @macdemarco - Shot at Le Bar Fleuri , Paris - July
  2023\n\nSeated in a small Parisian bistro, Mac Demarco and the members of his band
  have just put down their forks. It's the last call, and the kitchen is about to
  close. The band picks up their instruments and starts an impromptu acoustic concert
  for the few regulars of this typical brasserie. Alternating new tunes, fan favorites
  and silly jokes with the mellow energy of a hungover day. \n\nFin de service is
  the new series of Blogothèque, home of the Take Away Shows, its viral YouTube series
  since 2006.\n\n00:00 Intro\n00:57 20221102 The Truth\n5:03 20191009 I Like Her\n8:11
