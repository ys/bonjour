description: Black umbrellas and large comfy cushions were spread all over the sand.
  There was music shouting in the speakers and an enthusiastic voice commentating
  the competition. Not so different from any other surf fest, right? But then, you’d
  jump on a booth decorated with rainbow flags from the LGBTQIA+ community. You’d
  skate on a wooden ramp with committed girls from an association giving women access
  to skateboarding, and you’d talk with a member of a foundation fighting violence
  against women in the Basque country.Biarritz hosted the very first edition of the
  Queen Classic Surf Festival on the Côte des Basques beach, a 100%-female organized
  surf competition founded by local surfers and friends Amaya Gomis, Aimée & Margaux
  Arramon-Tucco – a tribute to women and those who don’t recognize themselves in the
  extreme binary stereotypes encouraged by the industry. Long Live the Queen! “We
  wanted to confront our surfing community with conversations they’re not used to
  having”
