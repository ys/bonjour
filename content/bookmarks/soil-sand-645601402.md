description: |-
  Early in 2022, myself along with two great friends, Rich Blake and Noah Lane travelled to Nicaragua to document the journey of directly sourcing coffee and combining a shared love of travel and surf. Soil & Sand is the outcome, a book and coffee box set, celebrating coffee, photography, travel and surfing.Â 

  A Super 8 short film by James Bowden

  In collaboration with Yallah Coffee & Foam Bundoran
