title: DÉPLACER LE SILENCE with Lola Mignot
domain: vimeo.com
description: "I traveled to Biaritz for the the Queens Surf Festival in June, but
  the good weather and waves enticed me to stay until the last months of summer. \n\nI
  met Oscar Valencia and  really liked his film work. This project came along very
  organically. Oscar wanted to capture the timeless summer in Biarritz, and that’s
  what we did. We shared good food, good wine, good waves, and good naps with the
  best crew in the shining warm European sun. \n\nThe ocean always has its way of
  being unpredictable; the tides change drastically the surf had to be well-timed
  and the the waves were not always in our favor, but Oscar was up for all of it.
  My good friend Margaux Arramon Tucco showed us around her home town, she always
  knew were the waves where and brought us the best local spots. Margaux and my cousin
  Chacha who were always around for the adventure make a guest appearance in the film.\n\nMaking
  this little movie was a lot of fun, in and out of the water.\n\nFilmed in 16mm/8mm\n\nDirected
  by Oscar Valencia.\nStarring Lola Mignot.\nGuest Appearances Margaux Arramon Tucco
  And Charlotte Lea Mignot\nVoice Over By Margaux Arramon Tucco\nGraphic Design by
  Alfredo Ardanza \nMusic Composition and Sound Design by Luis Ortega\nSoundtrack
