 ![Villa Vassdal Takes Refined Nordic Design to Sweden's West Coast](//images.ctfassets.net/r7p9m4b1iqbp/7iqPsVWVJDgkto6vpWRS0m/4acc0197eec9196f7fae80b1ddb1ea4f/Villa-Vassdal-Cabin-Sweden-Thumb.jpg?w=10&q=1&fm=jpg&fl=progressive) 

"Beach house” isn’t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Swedish getaways, but [Villa Vassdal by Studio Holmberg](https://www.studioholmberg.se/) proves that the graceful simplicity of Scandinavian design, featured in many a [striking mountain cabins](https://www.fieldmag.com/articles/mork-ulnes-mylla-hytte-plywood-cabin-norway), translates well to the [coastal variety](https://www.fieldmag.com/articles/modern-coastal-micro-cabins-go-logic-maine) too.

On a small island in Sweden’s Gothenburg archipelago, this seaside cabin (with a vibe similar to that of famed [Vega Cottage](https://www.fieldmag.com/articles/vega-norway-cabin-architecture-inspiration)) was built for a retired couple looking for a holiday home. With historical connections to Gothenburg's fishing and shipping industries, the island now plays host to year-round residences, as well as vacation houses primarily used in the summer.

Made up of a cluster of low-profile pitched roof volumes, the cabin’s design blends in with the surrounding rocky-outcrops. Sitting snuggly within its site, the plan is oriented to shield the view of neighbors and the glare of the sun, while opening up the living spaces to [ocean views](https://www.fieldmag.com/articles/best-beach-cabin-airbnb-cottage-rentals-in-maine).

With both exterior walls and roofs clad in untreated heart-pine, the structure appears almost monochromatic, allowing the volumes to be featured over materiality. The heart-pine will gray with age, further camouflaging the cabin within its site.

The wide pitched roofs inform much of the birch [plywood-lined interior](https://www.fieldmag.com/articles/snow-peak-tiny-house-jyubako-available-in-usa). A wide-open, spacious living area abuts a sleeping, bathing, and storage wing, where the sloped ceilings make for cozy corners that host amenities like a workstation and washroom. The familiar Nordic balance of beauty and utility is found throughout, most overtly in the living area, where a wall of built-in grid-like shelving features a woodstove front and center.

Serene and meditative, the cabin looks like the perfect place to tune out and tune into the waves. Sign us up.
