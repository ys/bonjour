title: End of the Land featuring Mike Lay in Cornwall
domain: youtu.be
description: |-
  For the second instalment of Surfdome’s End of the Land series, they spent a few Lay days with Cornish Renaissance man and Reef ambassador Mike Lay, at his home near England’s westernmost tip.

  The saver of lives, writer of poetry, hanger of 5s and 10s, driver of tractors and planter of trees showed us round his family’s new farm, in between some typically nimble longboarding along the Penwith peninsula. This is the Lay of the Land. Film by @sam_breeeze @sethshughes @afishout0fwater
