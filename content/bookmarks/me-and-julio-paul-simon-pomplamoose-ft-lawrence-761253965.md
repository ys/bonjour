description: "If you don’t know the band @lawrencetheband, you must go listen to them
  NOW. I’m just so glad that we were able to do something together while they were
  on the West Coast. And to get to do this CLASSIC PAUL SIMON song too. It was…heaven.
  But like a surprisingly difficult heaven, where you wish you’d been able to rehearse
  your part more but whatever it’s fine.\n\nSave this song on Spotify: https://spoti.fi/2r3Yqkh\nFollow

  by the schoolyard\nSeein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard\n\nWell, Mama pajama
  rolled outta bed\nAnd she ran to the police station\nAnd when the Papa found out,
  and began to shout\nHe started the investigation\n\nIt's against the law, it was
  against the law\nWhat that Mama saw, oh it was against the law\n\nThe Mama looked
  down and spit on the ground\nEvery time my name gets mentioned\nThe Papa said \"Oy!
  if I get that boy\nI'm gonna stick him in the house of detention\"\n\nWell I'm on
  my way, I don't know where I'm going\nI'm on my way, I'm taking my time, but I don't
  know where\nGoodbye Rosie, the queen of Corona\nSeein' me and Julio down by the
  schoolyard\nSeein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard\n\nIn a couple of days, they're
  gonna take me away\nBut the press let the story leak\nWhen the radical priest come
  to get me released\nWe was all on the cover of Newsweek\n\nWell I'm on my way, I
  don't know where I'm going\nI'm on my way, I'm taking my time, but I don't know
  where\nGoodbye Rosie, the queen of Corona\nSeein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard\nSeein'
  me and Julio down by the schoolyard\nSeein' me and Julio down by the schoolyard\nSeein'
  me and Julio down by the schoolyard\n\nOh oh, down by the schoolyard\nDown by the
  schoolyard\nDown by the schoolyard"

Gimme a band that sounds right and has great cover songs. I can listen to that for ours.
