**Each character’s design begins with a vector skeleton, (or series of coordinates) that a router would typically interpret and then carve into a wooden sign.**

From there, we adjust each skeleton to be comfortably legible at each weight, and finally apply optical adjustments where an analog router can’t.

**The result is a typeface that suits a variety of uses at different sizes, while staying true to much of the unique character and warmth of

its inspiration.
