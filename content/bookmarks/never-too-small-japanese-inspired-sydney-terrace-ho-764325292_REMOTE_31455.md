  Drawing inspiration from Japanese temples and hidden gardens, architect Jennifer McMaster of TRIAS transformed this small, dark, run-down Sydney terrace house into a peaceful, refined and personalised retreat for her creative clients and their beloved pets. McMaster’s redesign centred on opening up the lower level and introducing a central interior courtyard, creating a light-filled, green space around which to dine, work, live and unwind, with the upper level converted into an open plan bedroom–bathroom suite.  The house is filled with personalised touches, from the hand made terracotta floor tiles to the custom-designed furniture like the sofa, dining table, and daybed. A unique L-shaped bench doubles as a bookshelf, seating, and a step into the elevated kitchen area. Through the reimagining of this heritage space, Hidden Garden House illustrates the potential that lives all around us.

I always admire such minimalist small japanese inspired homes. I feel like this is where I would live without my second half of me that is the messy one.
