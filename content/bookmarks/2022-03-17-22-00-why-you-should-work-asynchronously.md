**TL;DR:** Asynchronous work allows for remote work that’s enjoyable and that actually works. Async increases inclusivity, produces better outcomes faster, encourages discoverability and permanence of context, creates space for learning, shifts knowledge workers to higher value work, improves work-life balance, empowers distributed teams, and enables parallelization and flow.

Most corporations (and their employees) made the shift to remote work during the pandemic. Many of these shifts were to remote-capable workflows (moving offline workflows online), but they [never made the maturity leap to fully remote-first](https://ma.tt/2020/04/five-levels-of-autonomy/), rendering their employees less productive and more likely to burn out. The difference between being _able_ to work remotely and [being able to _thrive_ remotely](https://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/my-long-distance-relationship-with-github/) is the ability to work not just digitally, but also to work _asynchronously_, and it brings with it a number of benefits not possible under legacy workflows.

Evolving beyond Cold War workflows
----------------------------------

Most corporate workflows have not evolved significantly from [their cold war predecessors](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/18/tools-to-empower-open-collaboration/). Sure, we’ve replaced typewriters with laptops, inter-office mail with email (or Slack), and in-person meetings with Zoom, but if you diagram out how people work and how information flows, not much has changed over the past seventy or so years beyond the cadence. We’ve digitized paper-based workflows, but we haven’t reimagined them for the modern (and distributed) world.

Working asynchronously
----------------------

Asynchronous work is knowledge workers’[1](#fn:5) natural evolution beyond the assembly-line-inspired, ad-hoc, and bespoke workflows that continue to influence most companies today. Specifically, working asynchronously is defined as:

*   not requiring people to be in a certain place at a certain time, or working on a certain thing at a certain time,
*   allowing individuals to be productive without waiting for others to respond or complete a task,
*   reducing batch size so that work can progress faster than its slowest component,
*   minimizing unplanned interruptions and demands for immediate attention,
*   decoupling work from communication,[2](#fn:4) and ultimately
*   granting workers the trust to work autonomously in the pursuit of shared goals.

Benefits of working asynchronously
----------------------------------

Async work is [a forcing function](https://ben.balter.com/2015/09/21/open-source-behind-the-firewall/#how-you-work-is-as-important-as-what-you-work-on) that not only replicates the outcomes of synchronous work,[3](#fn:6) but makes it more productive and more enjoyable than working in person. Specifically:

*   **Inclusivity** - When done right, async work is timezone agnostic. It also reduces proximity bias and access to information imbalance. There’s no “you had to be there”, when “there”, is “online” and “anytime”. Additionally, async means that all voices, not just the loudest, fastest to unmute, or most extroverted, are able to contribute to the conversation.
*   **Produces better outcomes faster** - Async encourages higher-quality communication and planning by forcing a shift to better (even if _perceived_ to be slower), more deliberate decision-making. It reduces ambiguity, imprecision, and churn through distillation of ideas and intentions that over time, will allow teams to ship the best ideas faster.[4](#fn:7)
*   **Discoverability and permanence** - By capturing and linking decisions, process, and artifacts, async naturally places a heavy reliance on written communications, documentation, discoverability, permanence, openness, self-documentation, succinctness, and transparency. This unlocks [a number](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/#the-value-of-giving-concepts-urls) of [benefits](https://ben.balter.com/2022/02/16/leaders-show-their-work/#the-value-of-showing-your-work).
*   **Create space for learning** - Most of us don’t learn at the speed of synchronous human interaction. In addition to allowing for passive observation and lightweight participation, async creates the necessary space for reflection, processing, and ultimately learning. This is true of both the business or technical problem at hand and the organizational culture and values that it socializes through its operation.
*   **Shift to higher-value work** - By not requiring knowledge workers ([especially managers](https://ben.balter.com/2012/12/16/deprecate-management/)) to spend countless cycles shuttling information around the organization, async shifts workers from low value work to higher value work, allowing them to solve novel, more interesting, and if you believe [creative minds want to be creative](https://ben.balter.com/2013/02/04/what-is-a-hacker/#the-hacker-way), ultimately more enjoyable problems. As a result, the shift to async simultaneously increases both productivity and overall job satisfaction.
*   **Work-life balance** - When work becomes largely time-agnostic, it allows for greater flexibility and work-life balance. Work is measured on its impact, not time in seat, meaning employees can schedule their working hours around child care, personal commitments,[5](#fn:3) and when they personally work best.
*   **Distributed teams** - Async allows distributed teams to thrive, meaning your team can tap into the world’s top talent, expand your business globally, and enable “follow the sun” work by spanning across timezones. This is especially beneficial for on-call roles like incident response or SRE that can be on call during their local working hours and for customer-facing roles like support, sales, and marketing that specialize in the regions where they are located.
*   **Parallelization and flow** - Async necessitates adopting non-blocking workflows that allow for [parallelization of work](https://remote.com/blog/why-you-should-be-doing-async-work)[6](#fn:1) and ultimately [encourage flow](https://ben.balter.com/2020/03/18/tips-for-working-remotely/#1-prefer-asynchronous-communication).[7](#fn:2) It’s the shift from waterfall to agile, but applied to personal and organizational time management and productivity.
