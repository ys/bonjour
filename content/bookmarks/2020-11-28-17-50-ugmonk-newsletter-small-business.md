Every year I like to send out an email highlighting some of my favorite small businesses.

**But this year feels particularly important to shop small. The pandemic has forced thousands of independent shops to temporarily or permanently shut down.**

I'll be honest, before I started Ugmonk I never thought much about “shopping small” but now being the owner of a small business I've come to realize how much every dollar counts to keep us little guys going.

As we get into gift-buying mode for the holidays, let's vote with our dollars and support independent creators and brands.

. . . . .

**❤️ Here are some of my favorite small brands and products that also make great gifts:**
