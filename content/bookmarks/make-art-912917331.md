  I wanted to find a way to take away the permission I felt I needed from the online world ie. Instagram to create art and express myself without having to fit into one of the prescribed parameters.
  If there is a message here then I would say do whatever the fuck you want and try and do it well. I think as a creative who doesn’t want to make stupid videos to post on social media or make things that don’t align with who I am it’s difficult to get recognition and become somewhat of a name in this field.
