Welcome back to another Case Study where we take a deeper dive into the lives of the shapers we work with here at Daydream Surf Shop. In this episode, we get a sneak peek into the life and shaping career of Alex Lopez, one of the most down to earth and humble shapers we've ever had the pleasure of getting to know.You might've noticed Alex's last name, Lopez, and yes he's the son of Mr. Pipeline himself, one of Daydream's favorite surfers, and surf history's most stylish, zen charger: Gerry Lopez. Alex is the last person that would bring up this relationship, it's as if he'd rather people not know that so that he can earn his own stripes as a surfer and shaper. Needless to say, Alex has carved out his own unique path in a way that's pretty unique. Although he grew up on Maui, Alex moved to Oregon when was young and became infatuated with snowboarding. Snowboarding was (and still is) an outlet for enjoying nature; although Alex picked up a couple snowboarding sponsors and worked a little for Volcom along the way. He had always dabbled with surfing but it wasn't until he met his girlfriend, Leah Dawson that his surfing and shaping career really began to take off. Leah has her own incredible story as a professional surfer, activist, and entrepreneur... needless to say, she definitely deserves an entire Case Study episode of her own. Alex has been shaping her boards for over five years and during this time he's been able to hone in on specific models that she's helped refine to allow her to surf with the freedom that reflects her individualistic style. This constant conversation and empirical analysis revolving around refining his surfboard designs is what has accelerated his career into the projection that it's seeing today. Having a "team rider" that's also your partner is great but it really kicks it up a notch when that person shreds every board under the sun from big wave single fins on the North Shore of Oahu to logging micro waves here in Southern California and everything in between. Alex and Leah now live in Oceanside, CA where Alex is surfing and shaping on a daily basis. You'll catch him with a pretty rad crowd of open minded and talented shredder-shapers such as Ryan Burch who's surfing Rocky Point on one of Alex's boards in the open part of this Case Study. Again, Alex is the last person to drop names like this as he flies under the radar with his ultra chill attitude. One thing that he can't hide is his ability to shape some incredible boards and we are so jazzed to be working with him. Lucky for you, we just got a big batch of boards from Alex so swing by the shop and check them out, these things won't be on our racks for very long. If you miss your chance, we also offer some demos for you to surf through the Daydream Research Center.https://daydreamsurfshop.com/collections/surfboardshttps://daydreamsurfshop.com/pages/surf-club

Meet Eeli Ethel Polli of Polli Pots, she's a Denmark based ceramicist who comes from a family of multigenerational artists from Estonia. She makes every piece by hand and paints individual designs with her glaze. Here's a glimpse into how Eeli sees her work:

"I like to describe my design style as minimalist, rustic and functional. Inspired by nature and organic in shape. I have lots of ceramics and pottery from a variety of artists, some very rare and hard to find. I place the pottery like small art objects in my living room, book shelves, and bathrooms. These handmade pieces tell a story and my friends who visit are always asking to find and hear about my newest piece. I live in new minimalist house with white walls and these ceramics give my home a rustic, earth-colored aesthetic."

On this installment of Daydream's Shop Spotlight, we'll be talking about Ally Garvin and her space, **[Neat Coffee](http://www.neat.coffee/)**!  Neat is located on 19th and Pomona in the heart of Westside Costa Mesa, a neighborhood in need of good coffee and a communal space. 

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/7C4EFB50-2CB0-4737-95C2-EEDDDB7D41F8_2048x2048.JPG?v=1567626955)

In Ally's cute little space, she serves up excellent coffee roasted by Arcade in Riverside, CA and features other great roasters which are rotated quarterly. Their menu consists of the standard specialty coffee choices and few Neat specials. Ally creates a seasonal syrup of the month that features ingredients prominent for the time of year. So far, her creations consist of blueberry basil mint, apple sage, juniper rose, tangerine cardamom and plum cardamom. While each of these sound magnificent, our favorite Neat specialty has got to be the Coffee Soda. Shake some coffee concentrate, mint, cardamom, sugar and lime and pour it over some sparkling water. That thing is so refreshing and crushable, perfect for the last blazing weeks of summer.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/2949F630-4A6C-447E-81A9-0AECBE92EDB6_2048x2048.JPG?v=1567626950)

On the food side of things, Chef Ashlee is holding it down. There's a super tasty granola bowl but the stars have got to be her toasts. Their avocado toast is anything but standard. Top with a slew of crunchy greens and an optional 7-minute egg, its savory, crunchy and refreshing. The pan con tomate is a hearty tomato puree drizzled in olive oil, perfect for an early lunch. Lastly, the jam toast is a light post-breakfast snack to get you through the morning. The food won't stop here, though. With plans to build out the backyard into a chill patio area comes a menu expansion into more developed lunch items. Stay tuned!

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/875A86BD-50D7-4C42-8D9F-130F4BE3AE9C_2048x2048.JPG?v=1567626956)

Ally and Neat are are on the up and up now with only more good things to come but this all started from humble beginnings with challenges and hardship along the way. Ally initially fell in love while working with a non-profit in Uganda. While at a coffee farm, she discovered the beauty of coffee at its origin. The lifeblood of a community a world away from her own yet so ingrained in the daily habits of home. She returned to Costa Mesa with dreams of creating her own coffee shop for her community.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/D61FF139-7078-4D03-944C-57EDD7C344A5_2048x2048.JPG?v=1567626956)

It was around 2010 and the only real specialty coffee in the area was Portola. At the time, a bastion for creation but also often inaccessible to those on the outside. Ally decided to start at Peet's and later Sidecar with the goals of attaining more coffee knowledge as well as business experience. After gaining all she could from these places, Neat was the next step. It started as a pop-up and ran for 2 1/2 years in an office building off Red Hill Avenue. Over time, the community around Neat grew and when she was forced to close the pop-up, Ally felt an obligation to the community to make Neat a permanent institution. It took some time, but in April of 2019, Neat came out guns-a-blazin' with a new team built mostly of former customers and a new spot in a prime zone. 

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/9993ADDF-1C3E-47E7-9106-B497CB109F6E_2048x2048.JPG?v=1567626957)

Ally's coffee background is different than most of the Orange County coffee professionals. They all came from Theorem with a pedigree for success in the industry. She didn't have the resume or years of experience, but she had a drive to create a welcoming space for people in her neighborhood. She'd get the rest of the knowledge along the way. She admitted to us that she doesn't know what she's doing running a business in this industry but took the chance and bet on herself to succeed. 

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/6B7271D0-7747-4634-A360-8E979662513C_2048x2048.JPG?v=1567626956)

Ally's favorite thing about what she does is serving food and drinks to the her neighbors. She created Neat with the sole intention of fostering community and we couldn't be more thankful. Neat is a perfect addition to the family of specialty coffee that has grown here in Orange County. We can't wait to see where she goes. We're sure it'll be real Neat ;)

Our third installment of Shop Spotlight is featuring **[Dayglow](https://dayglow.coffee/)**, formerly Neon, in Silver Lake and its founder/owner, Tom Ifregen.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/JPEG_image-47AB6F388159-7_2048x2048.jpeg?v=1558311379)

Tom, like many in the SoCal specialty coffee scene, came from Portola's R&D division called Theorum. Here, he and the crew specialized in coffee analysis and experimentation to better understand how it can be used in crafting beverages. Like many who came through Portola, when Theorum ended and Portola shifted towards expansion, Tom sought out new avenues to pursue his passion. After working with Bryant for a while at his shop, Bad Coffee, Tom went out on his own and opened Neon, now Dayglow.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/JPEG_image-47AB6F388159-11_2048x2048.jpeg?v=1558311377)

Tom explained to us that his goal with Dayglow was to create a brand to explore coffee. What this looks like in practice is a highly curated space and brand image that stretches across all forms of media. The cafe functions more as a coffee retail space and tasting room. Dayglow works with around 30 different roasters and features a **[coffee subscription service](https://dayglow.coffee/collections/subscriptions)** where each coffee is handpicked by Tom from his available offerings.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/JPEG_image-47AB6F388159-5_2048x2048.jpeg?v=1558311379)

Tom also works directly with roasters to pick green coffee to be roasted by them exclusively for Dayglow. These coffees come complete with unique packaging featuring the producer, roaster and Dayglow. Each coffee has with it specific brewing specifications to get the best experience from each one. Lastly, each comes with not just information on the coffee itself but also on the producer including openly discussing the financial compensation and support for them from the roaster and Dayglow. This concept brings a whole new level of collaboration and transparency between farmer, roaster and brewer.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/JPEG_image-47AB6F388159-6_2048x2048.jpeg?v=1558311379)

Dayglow's reasoning for being a multi-roaster rather than roasting themselves is two-fold. Tom feels that the roaster market has become somewhat over-saturated. There are so many specialty roasters but very few really setting themselves apart from the pack in a positive and meaningful way. There was no need to add another name to that pool. Also, if someone is doing an excellent job at something, why not work with them rather than trying to reinvent the wheel?

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/JPEG_image-47AB6F388159-10_2048x2048.jpeg?v=1558311377)

The future for Tom and Dayglow is a bright one. In the coming months, a second Dayglow will be opening in downtown LA. Tom is also working with his brother on a space in Chicago which will feature coffee by Tom along with a brewery and restaurant. The world couldn't get enough of Dayglow and Tom obliged. Silver Lake, DTLA, Chicago and who knows where else?

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/JPEG_image-47AB6F388159-2_2048x2048.jpeg?v=1558311378)

This bright future was almost nipped in the bud early on by a controversy that surrounded Dayglow's former name, Neon. Tom was served a cease and desist from Minneapolis roaster Dogwood over the name as they had copyrighted the moniker "NEON Espresso." This forced Tom to rebrand his entire business early on which could've doomed it from the start. Instead, he bounced back stronger than ever to win a Sprudgie for "Best New Cafe." This also prompted the creation of Tom's infamous "Coffee from around the globe except Minneapolis" shirt. If you know Tom at all, you know that this shirt is clearly a jest and he holds no ill will towards Minneapolis.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/JPEG_image-47AB6F388159-8_2048x2048.jpeg?v=1558311379)

Regardless of who's side you take in this dispute, we can all agree that all of us in specialty coffee should be supportive of each other rather than petty and combative. There's room for all of us to serve excellent coffee and our market here supports thousands of farmers and workers around the world. Spread good vibes and enjoy the craft just like Dayglow does.

Welcome to the second installation of our Community Spotlight which will focus on Bryant Trinh and his crew at Bad Coffee. Bad Coffee is a sweet little multi-roaster in Costa Mesa that took over a space that was previously a different coffee shop and breathed new life into a left behind location. Bryant took over what was previously a Hidden House and gave it a slick makeover in black and white, a fresh outlook on what coffee to serve and how to serve it as well a focus on creating a community around it.  
![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/Attachment-3_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1550632668)Bryant, like so many of leading figures in Orange County specialty coffee, started at Portola years ago while still in college. And, like so many of us coffee professionals, accidentally fell in love with not only the craft but the community around it. Portola was a place where he met and worked with like-minded people and could feel comfortable getting his schoolwork done. When it was time to move on and forward from Portola, he kept in mind the feeling that it had given him when he started there and set out to create that for others. Fast forward a few years and we arrive at Bad Coffee. When it comes to community, being located on Harbor and Adams puts Bad on the main thoroughfare in and out of Costa Mesa for whether you live, work, or go to school here. Perhaps what is most notable to us is it's proximity to Orange Coast College, one of California's leading transfer schools for community college. Many of us at Daydream are either OCC alumni or are currently taking classes there. Bad is the perfect place to link up with friends to study, lurk solo and smash integrals after calculus class, or take a break from campus to chill and enjoy some delicious coffee. Students are cats that need coffee and it's rad to see Bad catering to this demographic without jeopardizing quality.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/Attachment-1_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1550632764)

When it comes to specialty coffee, there's nothing more important than quality. Close behind quality is creativity and Bad also has that checked off the list as well. In terms of selecting roasters Bryant has an excellent palate and also strives to select roasters that aren't currently being tapped into within Orange County. Without giving away too many of his creative ways when it comes to espresso, Bryant is interested in dabbling with variables others hold fixed such as bars of pressure pressure. Although we normally come in for delicious coffee, Bad also turns out some delicious non-coffee options that rotate. Rounding out the creative forefront for Bad Coffee has to be their graphic design. Bryant is always turning out epic tees, stickers, and swag that we're stoked on.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/Attachment-4_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1550632796)

  
One component we think is often overshadowed by Bad Coffee's community, quality, and creativity is it's business strategy. In choosing to acquire an existing business Bryant was able to approach the start to his business in a unique way. When starting a business one of the hardest things to do is find enough money that you need to get the thing up and running. In an acquisition, you are borrowing to fulfill an agreement with the business you're acquiring and is usually attached to assets that hold value.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/Attachment-2_a9aedf8d-f50a-4da7-8609-0c42a3fd2d46_1024x1024.jpeg?v=1550633678)

When starting a business from scratch, you're essentially going to a bank and telling them you have no assets but you have a great idea... banks don't think ideas are worth very much until they have a track record of success which means it can be really hard to get a business loan from a bank when you're just starting out with your first business. Anyone who has tried definitely knows what I'm talking about and what a harsh realization it is to be confronted with. Maybe starting a business through acquisition could be easier to get funding for and can often have some other perks such as lease agreements that could lock you into a below market rate for a number of years. This could also be a cool angle for those looking to start a business with great ideas but little to no funding. Imagine a world where more creative cats made offers to acquire spaces looking for an exit strategy. That could mean more young and creative business owners finding access to funding.

The Great Fire of 11/11/16 burnt all the garages behind our warehouse complex... our shop was narrowly missed.

Welcome to episode three of our short film series, **[Field Notes](https://vimeo.com/daydreamsurfshop)**, filmed and edited by **[Jack Coleman](https://vimeo.com/user2241852)**. In this episode we're joined by some very talented shredders **[Makala Harmony Smith](https://www.instagram.com/shredsista/)** and **[River Covey](https://www.instagram.com/rivercovey/?hl=en)** gliding with style on some new **[Gato Heroi](https://www.instagram.com/gatoheroi/?hl=en)** sleds! Makala is riding her dashing, abstract resin tinted 9'7" **[Fluer](https://daydreamsurfshop.com/collections/surfboards/products/96-gato-heroi-fluer)** while River takes to his crisp, clean 9'8" **[Californian](https://daydreamsurfshop.com/collections/surfboards/products/910-gato-heroi-californian)**. These boards are incredibly fun for a diverse spectrum of waves. Robin Kegel, the shaper behind Gato Heroi, has been building boards since he was a teenager, first getting his start here in Costa Mesa as well as Dana Point, Kegel is now in his 30's and widely known for pushing the envelope of surfboard design on an international level (amongst other things like working with Acne Studios developing fashion campaigns). He travels from country to country shaping massive batches of boards for lucky folks in California, Australia, Japan, Italy, and his home base in France. We're beyond jazzed to currently have a large stock of Gato Heroi's available in our **[shop](https://daydreamsurfshop.com/collections/surfboards)** to purchase new or demo through the **[Daydream Research Center](https://daydreamsurfshop.com/pages/surf-club)**. 

Kegel pulls a lot of design influence from surfing's **[Transition Era](https://daydreamsurfshop.com/blogs/news/transition-era-appreciation-night)** of the late 1960's to shoot for a well rounded approach to dynamic logging allowing the surfer to ride the board from nose to tail and surf each wave with a speed oriented flow. There are few better cats out there to demonstrate the proper way to approach surfing Gato Herois than Makala and River. Makala really exemplifies the effortlessness of rolling her Fluer over from rail to rail off the beautifully arching pin tail with style and grace wile keeping her feet actively dancing around on the board. River's similar clean flow on the Californian is juxtaposed by his unpredictable lines from taking off fin first and hanging five off the tail to switch stance noseriding with full control. Gato Heroi has a great group of advocates to illustrate the creative intersection of historical surfboard design influence with a contemporary refinement that Robin Kegel employs. 

A special thanks to Jack Coleman, Makala Harmony Smith, River Covey, and Robin Kegel for all being so talented at what they do.

One of the goals we hope to accomplish with our blog is to highlight those in our industry and community who are doing some new and unique things and, more importantly, doing it well. In this segment, we’ll be putting a spotlight on some people that are doing some really rad things over in downtown Santa Ana.  
![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/BY3A5598_b6743e54-173a-4222-97e6-bfea645cfc46_1024x1024.jpg?v=1533165295)Truman Severson and Andrew Ogden are the driving force behind DTSA’s innovating multi-roaster, Hopper & Burr. We are constantly telling our friends and patrons that their spot is one of our favorite places to have coffee outside of Daydream but we could never quite put our finger on why. Yes, they’re extremely skilled craftsmen who serve amazing coffee and specialty beverages day-in and day-out. Yes, they are only choosing to serve the freshest, best crop coffees from the most progressive roasters. But its something other than just the quality of their product that makes them our go-to. There’s something special that just makes us want to be in their space and experience what they’re about. We sat down with the two of them to get to the bottom of the phenomena that is Hopper & Burr.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/BY3A5538_1024x1024.jpg?v=1533163868)

After some light jokes from Andrew, a master of off-color humor with perfectly dry delivery, we got down to the nitty gritty of what sets them apart from the rest. Truman used the phrase “redeeming the neighborhood coffee shop” which we loved. He explained it somewhat as taking that old idea of the janky local shop where everyone knows your name and your order and elevating that. He described to us the unique community that DTSA provides to them. It is the only real city center or minor metropolitan area in Orange County other than Orange to a lesser extent; a business/financial district surrounded by residential areas that draw everyone to the center in a melting pot of the local Hispanic community mixing with a younger, mostly white, “hipster” population that has ben moving into the area. They talked about retaining customers from the early days when they were just a pop-up and trying to create a space that can serve that coffee nerd but also the flower lady from up the street without compromising the quality and standards of their product.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/BY3A5565_1024x1024.jpg?v=1533164620)

Andrew credited their success in creating this recurring base to their community-first attitude and their exuding of B.D.E. I’ll let you at home look up what that acronym actually stands for on Urban Dictionary but what it boils down to is carrying yourself and everything you do with a level of infallible confidence. Not a cockiness, but an assuredness in everything you do that convinces those around you to get psyched on it. Truman and Andrew are obviously masters of their craft that are constantly pushing the envelope of what a specialty coffee shop can be, but they never need to flaunt their skills or credentials to validate themselves to those coming into their shop. Their demeanor and poise says all of that and more. It only takes watching their café flow and customer interactions for a few minutes to recognize those things.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/BY3A5571_1024x1024.jpg?v=1533164775)

While those aspects of Hopper & Burr are our favorite things about it, don’t let that fool you into thinking that attention to every last detail of the craft is lacking in anyway. These guys milk their own almonds, make their own tonic and slush their own slushies. They live by the motto “if you can make it better, make it yourself.” Truman and Andrew are tight with the crew at the amazing gastropub right up the street, Playground. They guest bartend there and share ingredients and recipes. They create finely crafted beverages at the same level as the skilled bartenders at Playground but with coffee as their base. Just look at the Untitled Drink #1 or the infamous Painface Killah, a coffee take on a tiki drink. Their in-house tonic pairs perfectly with their beautiful espresso. They even bought a slushie machine to make watermelon/simcoe hops slushies and blendy sweet lattes. What was one of the biggest taboos for a specialty coffee shop, blended drinks, they turned into something all those elitist want to drink even if they won’t admit it.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/BY3A5584_1024x1024.jpg?v=1533164786)

Not only is their quality top-notch, but so is their flow and speed of service. Along with their rad barista team of Eric and Patrick, they cruise like a well-oiled machine through rushes, slinging some of the fastest and tastiest bevs in the west. Their bar is ergonomically designed for convenience of the barista equipped with iced coffee and milk on tap and a speed rail for additives. The bar design also serves a double purpose. No coffee is present on the bar and everything is subtle and low-key. This is to encourage conversation over coffee rather than about coffee. They’ll still nerd out about the craft if that’s what you’re looking for but they’d much rather hear about your kid’s soccer game or how your interview went last week.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/BY3A5542_1024x1024.jpg?v=1533164505)

And now we’ve come full circle from focus on the interactions with people, to quality and craft, and right back to the community. It’s all weaved into every bit of Hopper & Burr which is why we can’t get enough of that B.D.E. and tasty spro they serve up each day. We love what they’re about and if you love what we’re about here at daydream, we’re willing to bet you will, too.

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/BY3A5545_1024x1024.jpg?v=1533163677)

The level of positive energy and community interaction that these guys bring is crucial to our industry. For a long time, specialty coffee was inaccessible to so many people who weren’t already in the know. Baristas were unfriendly, condescending and uninterested in the people they were supposed to be serving. Years later, we are still fighting against this stigma. We put a huge emphasis on creating positive experiences for everyone who walks into our shop and clearly so does the gang at Hopper & Burr, which is why we always feel so stoked to be there!

For many, ordering coffee is their first human interaction of the day. This means we, the purveyors of coffee, often get to set the tone for how that day may go. We do not take that responsibility lightly. This may seem like the tiniest interaction, just a blip on the radar of someone’s entire day. But we want to make that a positive and impactful blip.

  
![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/daydreamnew-135.jpg?v=1531507973)

Our philosophy on coffee at Daydream starts with the people its being served to. We as coffee professionals care deeply about our craft, sometimes to fault. We strive to never lose sight of the fact that we are still a service industry. A company in service to our community. We are not only trying to serve the best coffee but are also working to create an environment that fosters creativity, camaraderie, and good vibes. We hope to be a space for people to come and feel comfortable being themselves and interacting with likeminded individuals.

  
![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/daydreamnew-134.jpg?v=1531507965)

A wise man once said, “Coffee is a catalyst.” By that, he meant it is the fuel for the conversations and interactions we have whilst enjoying it. It brings us together on a common ground. On that common ground, we can start to discover other things we mutually enjoy or, better yet, have our eyes opened to new possibilities and realities that we never considered before.

  
![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/daydreamnew-150.jpg?v=1531508392)

Through this blog, we hope to accomplish a few missions. We want to connect you with our staff. We’ll be doing interviews and write-ups on each of the Daydream family members to help you get to know them better and to show the world what an amazing crew we have. We will also be using the blog to help educate people about specialty coffee. We’ll be exploring the journey from cherry to cup, touching on the different origins of coffee, the different processing methods, how we import and export coffee and lastly, how we roast and serve coffee. Along the way, we’ll be debunking myths about coffee and the industry that have spread around.

  
![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/daydreamnew-42.jpg?v=1531508426)

If this all sounds like your cup of tea (or coffee) stayed tuned for all we’ve mentioned and more in the coming weeks! Along the way, let us know what topics you might like us to touch on pertaining to the specialty coffee industry and stop by whenever you're in town to hang with us!

Hi folks, we're jazzed to announce that we are hosting our first free public cupping here at Daydream! Join us Saturday, July 22nd from 1-2pm to taste and learn about some delicious coffees from Sightglass! 

To learn more about some of the coffees we'll be tasting, please read the detailed descriptions below. We look forward to having you join us!

![](//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1046/5210/files/SightglassDaydreamCupping_1024x1024.jpg?v=1500413564)

Colombia, Finca Alcatraz, Wilfredo Ule Vargas: Finca Alcatraz and the fine gentleman who owns and operates it, Wilfredo Ule Vargas, are near and dear to our hearts. Our relationship with Wilfredo is our oldest and strongest. In a real way, we have grown our businesses and lives together. On his farm, Wilfredo exceptionally produces Caturra, Typica and Bourbon. With each visit, Wilfredo is proud to share with us the strides he is making toward progressive and new developments in processing. Above his house he has constructed a covered drying patio complete with thermometer, moisture reader, and variable airflow mechanisms. Over the years, Wilfredo has managed to rebuild his entire house with the money he has received for his coffees, increasing the quality of life for his family immensely. Wilfredo’s passion for improvement and endless curiosity have proven to be his greatest assets as a coffee professional. We hope you enjoy the fruits of Wilfredo’s efforts as much as we do. 

Colombia, Alcatraz + Florestales: This exquisite collaboration of high quality coffee was produced by two of Sightglass' most essential Colombian producers, Wilfredo Ule and Maximino Gutierrez. Maximino's pure Yellow Caturra, paired with Wilfredo's Bourbon combine and make a memorable cup. Exactly what you would expect from two highly skilled coffee producers.

Colombia, La Laguna, William Torres: A short ride into the hills north of Pitalito, sits Finca La Laguna - named after the nearby Guaitipan Lagoon. William Fernando Torres operates the farm with his family and cultivates delicious coffee. Beyond having an in-depth knowledge of the exceptional terroir where his coffee is grown, William ensures the best cup profile by handling each step of the process with care. He hand-picks the ripest cherries, ferments the coffee for 24 hours, and then dries the parchment for around 15 days.

Ethiopia, Yetatebe, Shakisso: A Sightglass exclusive, a tremendous fully washed coffee from Shakisso in southern Ethiopia. This coffee comes from an estate well regarded in its region as sun-drying experts, winning various awards for their excellent profiles of naturally processed coffees. Many of the heirloom varieties that grow wild in and around the highlands of southern Ethiopia, where Yetatebe is located, are some of the finest and most sought after coffees on the planet. 

Rwanda, Kageyo Station, Ngororero: Sightglass is proud to be roasting coffee from the Kageyo Coop Station for the third year in a row. Many of the members who deliver cherry to the station are also part owners and all share the responsibilities of running the station. Kageyo is situated a bit higher in elevation, nestled in the mountains of the Ngororero District, where this subtle change in elevation from farm to washing station yields a coffee with much more sweetness and complexity than its lower elevation neighbors. An elegant coffee, with delicate notes of Earl Grey, a baked peach sweetness, and soft, whipped cream fnish.

Alternative surfboards are hands down my most passionate aspect of our surf shop. Not only am I obsessed with riding everything from hulls to bonzers to fishes to logs, it’s something that I feel really connected to in terms of it’s connection to the evolving landscape of surf culture. There’s definitely a shift afoot in the surfing world – more shapers and shops are supplying folks with alternative shapes and there is definitely a growing demand from open minded wave sliders. One aspect that seems to have helped aid this shift is the growing availability of these board from rad shop like Mollusk, Surfy Surfy, Pilgrim, etc. which has allowed more folks to try boards that they didn’t know that they liked. That being said, alternative boards take a very high level of craftsmanship to design and shape, which means that these boards have a higher, yet justified cost. Through our surf club at Daydream, we plan to allow this shift to expand by letting folks test out alternative boards so that you can lower the risk of purchasing a board that you may not like and increase the probability of you expanding your horizons as a surfer. I am also really excited to increase the rate at which information is shared about alternative boards to break down the information asymmetry that exists under the current pace of evolutionary shapes. Examples of this shift can be seen all over the world but it definitely seems to be concentrated in Southern California where we honorably house some of the best alternative surfboard sculptors including Ryan Lovelace, Ryan Burch, Rob Machado, Alex Knost, Brian Hilbers, Kyle Albers, Klaus Jones, Bob Mitsven, Chris Christenson, Renny Yater, Scott Anderson, Manny Mandala, Malcolm Campbell, Gary Hanel, Tanner Prairie, Tyler Warren and a host of young up and coming shapers that are leading the way in keeping the momentum of this shift alive. Below are some brief bullet points on the details of our surf club and how you can get involved.   

What boards will be available:

*   Hulls, sams, vintage logs, vee bottoms, eggs, 70’s style single fins, bonzers, fishes, mini simmons, finless and quasi-finless boards, and anything else that evolves!

How to get involved:

*   We are offering a limited number of people to access the surf club quiver, if interested please email us at daydreamsurfshop@gmail.com for further discussion. Others will be able to purchase session based packages for as few as 3 days or as much as an unlimited month of experimentation. The unlimited monthly package will also come with some nice perks such as the ability to reserve a board for multiple days

What are the goals of this surf club?

*   To educate and accelerate the information shared through surfboard experimentation
*   Increase the probability of folks purchasing boards they know they are going to love
*   Increase aggregate stoke levels!

How do you envision the interaction at Daydream with surf club members?

*   I hope that our surf club members will stop by for their morning cup of coffee, discuss their intentions for the day and how the correct pairing of a particular wave and a particular board might help inspire and balance them as they navigate their post-surf activities
*   This is definitely intended to be a long term relationship, we want folks to come back from their session and share information with us such as what you liked or disliked or how the experience differed from their expectations
*   An ongoing diognostic analysis will be documented to keep track of what is or isn’t working 

Who is the ideal surf club member?

*   An open minded surfer who sees the ocean as a source energy for positivity, somewhere they go develop a relaxed awakening, tap into nature, and set an intention

I've spent way too much of my early 20's reading economic textbooks and novels... I guess the upside is that eventually you'll find a conceptual intersection between what you're studying academically and your creative recreation. For me, this is the performance art of wave riding.

Although we are embedded in an economic system that is focused on growth in metrics such as Gross Domestic Product & consumption, it is important to be curious about what these measures of well being actually mean and how it compares to an actual individual's measure of well being... this is much more eloquently put by the author of _Small Is Beautiful,_ British economist E. F. Schumacher. Nevertheless, I think it's important to take the current surfing ideology of externally adrenaline centric boundary pushing and invert it, turning the focus inward on the self and it's own unique form of self expression. If surfing big waves or doing mind blowing airs doesn't suit you, play to your strengths and what serves you in your aquatic adventures.

The owner of Mollusk Surf Shop, John McCambridge, and I were discussing an example of this through our experiences of night surfing. If you were surfing in the dark, with no one else around, and no one to watch you, how would your approach differ in comparison to your day-to-day sessions? John pointed out that he puts absolutely no focus on doing turns and turns his approach towards source energy acquisition. I think that nobody displays the essence of "small is beautiful" better than the first hand imagery of Alex Swanson with his twofeetandfiring hashtag. He really shows how those moments when you're just messing around in some average waves at Blackies can take you to a whole different interdimensional stoke sphere.

This is a focus on the individual, so remember, everyone is different; however, if you are experiencing something that others don't seem to experience, get curious, tap into that, keep doing what feels good. I for one would much rather watch someone go as straight as their heart desires than watch someone force a credit card air reverse.

With good vibes,

Kyle
