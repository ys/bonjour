title: On Apps and Coffee
domain: ia.net
description: 'No matter how many times developers compare their apps to coffee...
  apps are not coffee. The question is not: How many coffees does an app cost. It''s:
  How many apps does a cup of coffee cost? And the answer is: Apps are not coffee
  but coffee machines.'
