highlights: In real life, skating is an art form that requires constant sacrifice,
  physical pain and public embarrassment for the sake of an ephemeral few seconds
  of pure beauty. You have to fall a thousand times before you succeed. The Tony Hawk
  games aren’t concerned with that. They recreate the iterative satisfaction of skating
  — the feeling that, with enough practice, you can do something miraculous — without
  all the concussions, bloody knees and shattered wrists.
