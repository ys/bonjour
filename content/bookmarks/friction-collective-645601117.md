description: "We are Friction Collective, a film production house based in the heart
  of Bristol. \n\nThe power of storytelling is unparalleled and we’ll help you tell
  your story through powerful, meaningful and vibrant digital content. Life is way
  too short for dull marketing jargon; sometimes words alone just won’t cut it, so
  captivate and immerse your audience with visual media. Together we will find what
  makes you unique and shout it from the rooftops.\n\n“ A little less conversation,
  a little more action”. (sometimes you need to quote Elvis to emphasise a point!)"
