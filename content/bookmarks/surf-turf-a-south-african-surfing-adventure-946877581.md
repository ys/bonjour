title: Surf & Turf - A South African surfing adventure
domain: youtube.com
description: "When Arthur Auclert (https://instagram.com/el.druido) and Felix Lesouef
  (https://instagram.com/felixlesouef) set off from Cape Town in their trusty sand-colored
  car, Ernest their goal was simple: to explore South Africa’s breathtaking coastline,
  ride its iconic waves, and soak in the beauty of life on the road.\n\nOver a month
  and 7000 kilometers, their journey unfolded like a patchwork of experiences—some
  planned, many unexpected. From the legendary surf breaks of Jeffrey’s Bay to the
  quiet charm of the wild coast, from tropical beaches around Umzumbe to starlit nights
  in Hluhluwe National Park, they discovered the heart of South Africa through its
  landscapes, waves, and people.\n\nThis is a story of friendship and discovery. It’s
  about slowing down, taking in the small moments and finding connection in every
  corner of this remarkable country.\n\nA film by Arthur Auclert & Félix Lesouef.\n\nMusic
