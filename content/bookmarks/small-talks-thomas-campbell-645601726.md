title: Small Talks | Thomas Campbell
domain: player.vimeo.com
description: "We are proud to introduce artist, photographer, filmmaker and influencer,
  Thomas Campbell, as our newest Creator & Innovator. Thomas is a self-taught painter,
  sculpture, photographer, and filmmaker who splits his time between his stuff making
  studio in Bonny Doon, CA and traversing the globe making films. His artworks combine
  scribbles and scriptures, taking slogans and anecdotes from his unique vocabulary
  and juxtaposing them with a profound look at human nature. His movement-oriented
  paintings are as layered with meaning as they are with paint. The works, typically
  composed of several panels, are free-flowing with wide expressionist swipes of color,
  bold graphics and intricate renderings of characters and text. His photographs mimic
  the intensity of the paintings, yet in a more abstract fashion. \n\nCampbell has
  mounted solo exhibitions in New York, Paris, Tokyo, Denmark, The Netherlands, San
  Francisco, Los Angeles, and Morocco. In 1999, he completed his first feature length
  surfing film, The Seedling, and in 2004 released his second, Sprout and his third
  \"The Present\" in the spring of 2009. \n\nThomas is also part owner and creative
  director for a small, independent record label based in Santa Cruz, CA, Galaxia,
  which has released records by contemporary artists such as Tommy Guerrero, Bonnie
  \"Prince\" Billy, Peggy Honeywell and The Black Heart Procession. Galaxia was established
  in 1993. In 2013 Campbell started an new creative platform called UM YEAH ARTS which
  is a nexus for the making of books and music.\n\nFor more photos and behind the
