title: 'EN ROUTE: A portrait of Kenny Hurtado'
description: As a staff photographer for SURFING Magazine, Kenny Hurtado quickly made
  a name for himself in the industry, thanks to his stylistic approach and innate
  talent for shooting classic surf imagery. It wasn't until a trip to India opened
  his eyes to another side of photography and forced him to reevaluate his career
  path altogether.
