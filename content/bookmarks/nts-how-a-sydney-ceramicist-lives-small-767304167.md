description: "Nestled amidst the bustling streets of the dense inner city suburb of
  Darlinghurst, this quaint 47sqm terrace home with a small hidden courtyard garden
  is home to Laura, Aman and their pets Eric and Annie. Inspired by their time in
  Japan, their home and the objects they choose to bring into it, are a reflection
  of their dedication to a more sustainable, thoughtful way of living and an appreciation
  for good, functional design. \n\n#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign \n\nHow
