  Jimmy Jazz. Short stories, and abstract interludes from Mexico, Sumatra, Japan and
  Bali. Starring Karina Rozunko, Alex Knost, Holly Wawn, Lola Mignot, & friends Based
  off a Japanese style poem which depicts a tiny moment of time, suggestive of nature
  that evokes a definite, though unstated, emotional response. The film is a loose
  narrative involving a dream sequence and remote reality.\"\n\nMusical score by Monde
