description: "Okay you made it to the beginning, if you are reading this you are in
  the right place. X marks the spot. You Are Here. This session is a soft hand reaching
  out to help you befriend you. Prana as a series is about aligning with the wisdom
  of your body and being. On Day 1 you will get a taste for holistic yoga practice
  that takes a therapeutic approach to physical strength, joint health, nervous system
  resilience, and your mental wellness. Our primary focus is on the breath. \n\nDay
  1 practice time, 27 minutes. This is the longest session in the series. Slow down
  and use it to check in with your body, your breathing patterns, and your whole self
  fully. This practice sets you up so nicely for the rest of the series! It’s soft,
  it’s inquisitive, it has foundations for subtle body awareness as well as gross
  body work.  Day 1 asks you to be curious about what it feels like to move in this
  current season of your life. \n\nTap in. Listen. Let’s get your energy moving. \n\nThank
  you for showing up for yourself. Thank you for joining me. Please let me know how
  it goes for you in the comment section below! \n\nAll my love, \nAdriene\n\n- -
