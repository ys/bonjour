title: California's Best Swell in 30 years? | Searching by Log Rap
domain: youtube.com
description: "When rumors of an atmospheric river sending \"the best swell in 30 years\"
  to our backyard started to form my first thought was, \"I don't think we're gonna
  get any longboard clips for a minute.\" We woke up the first day of the swell to
  a slew of text messages from friends up and down the coast proclaiming \"all time\"
  and the sun hadn't even risen yet. Little did we know at the time, that's how the
  next 7 mornings were gonna be. Nonstop, endless searching for the perfect spot.
  These are some clips we captured during this seemingly endless week of Searching.
