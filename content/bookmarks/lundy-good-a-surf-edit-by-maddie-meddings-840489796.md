description: "Finisterre Ambassador Mike Lay is joined by architect Jacob Down and
  artist Holly Bendall, as they share waves on the shores of Lundy - the Shipping
  Forecast area that runs along Cornwall's north-facing coastline. \n\nTaking advantage
  of fair winds and a favourable forecast, the crew set out to make the most of the
  impossibly blue Atlantic waters at the westernmost edge of the land.\n\nCREDITS:
  \nSurfers: \n- Mike Lay \n- Holly Bendall\n- Jacob Down\n\nMusic: \n- Track 1: Sunflowers
  Of Your Mind, Daisy Rickman \n- Track 2: Chick Habit, The Velvet Hands\n\n#coldwatersurf
