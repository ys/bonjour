description: "Subscribe to Huckberry's YouTube: https://bit.ly/4blFPUK\n\nOn this
  episode of Huckberry Homes, we caught our good friend and photographer James Barkman
  out in the wild. He gave us a tour of his vintage \"Yellow Submarine\" inspired
  VW Van and broke down some of the modifications he has made to make this adventure
  bus feel more like home. \n\nOn Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most
  inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve
  crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges
  to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity
  and high-performing lives.\n\nLevel up your space with the Huckberry Home Shop:
