Hope your fall is off to a good start and you’re enjoying something apple or pumpkin-spice flavored. An apple cider donut right out of the fryer is probably my favorite fall treat.

I was honored to be a guest on [Mailchimp's podcast with Paul Jarvis](http://mailchimp.com/presents/podcast/call-paul/making-your-own-rules-with-ugmonk/?_kx=ZNSYUaE4mXnOEYYW_GvyYeFFKqXjaFpnCkMHemudBuY%3D.aVinKJ) to chat about how I'm making up my own rules as I go and how we weathered the past year. [You can listen to the episode here →](https://mailchimp.com/presents/podcast/call-paul/making-your-own-rules-with-ugmonk/?_kx=ZNSYUaE4mXnOEYYW_GvyYeFFKqXjaFpnCkMHemudBuY%3D.aVinKJ)

**Here are 5 things I'm currently digging...**

[GT Ultra](https://www.gt-ultra.com/?_kx=ZNSYUaE4mXnOEYYW_GvyYeFFKqXjaFpnCkMHemudBuY%3D.aVinKJ) is a beautiful new variable typeface from Grilli Type that dances between serif and san serif. Not only is the typeface gorgeous, but also [the mini site](https://www.gt-ultra.com/?_kx=ZNSYUaE4mXnOEYYW_GvyYeFFKqXjaFpnCkMHemudBuY%3D.aVinKJ) design is one of the best I've ever seen.

Was fun to hear the full [backstory of how Dude Perfect came to be](http://www.npr.org/2021/09/16/1038140265/dude-perfect-cory-cotton-and-tyler-toney?_kx=ZNSYUaE4mXnOEYYW_GvyYeFFKqXjaFpnCkMHemudBuY%3D.aVinKJ). I'm sure you've seen their impossible trickshots and stereotype videos that have gone viral, but hearing how they got to where they are today is super inspiring.

The interior design and branding for [Bentwood Cafe](https://www.behance.net/gallery/66517849/Bentwood-Cafe?_kx=ZNSYUaE4mXnOEYYW_GvyYeFFKqXjaFpnCkMHemudBuY%3D.aVinKJ) in Melbourne is so good. I love the contrast between the clean lines and old industrial textures. The materials, colors, typography, and signage are all so well-done. Mad props to Pop & Pac Studio.

The [Nordic Barnhouse Project](https://www.instagram.com/thenordicbarnhouseproject/?hl=en&_kx=ZNSYUaE4mXnOEYYW_GvyYeFFKqXjaFpnCkMHemudBuY%3D.aVinKJ) is about as beautiful of a house and property as I've ever seen. (Warning: Don't click the link unless you want major house envy :)

I've been absolutely loving [mymind](https://mymind.com/?_kx=ZNSYUaE4mXnOEYYW_GvyYeFFKqXjaFpnCkMHemudBuY%3D.aVinKJ). It's a visual bookmarking tool that allows you to quickly save images, links, notes, videos from anywhere. It's kind of like Pinterest but 100x simpler and better designed. I actually use [mymind](http://mymind.com/?_kx=ZNSYUaE4mXnOEYYW_GvyYeFFKqXjaFpnCkMHemudBuY%3D.aVinKJ) to save all of my links for these "5 Things" emails :)
