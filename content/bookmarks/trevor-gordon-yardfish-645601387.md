title: Trevor Gordon - Yardfish
domain: vimeo.com
description: |-
  With a fish missing in his quiver and only 2 days until we shoved off for the transatlantic crossing, Trevor; bloody and sweaty while working with piecemeal shaping equipment, squeaked out the Yardfish. A crude yet functional surf craft that gets ripped to shreds by the shaper along the journey. I glassed the board with brown vinyl ester resin the consistency of water and with no sanding resin to be found anywhere, we somehow still made that sticky pig fly.
