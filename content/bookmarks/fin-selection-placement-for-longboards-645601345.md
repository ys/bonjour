title: Fin Selection & Placement for Longboards
domain: almondsurfboards.com
description: 'Fin selection and fin placement are paramount for maximizing your equipment. 
  Adding the right new fin can unlock your longboard in eye-opening ways.  And conversely,
  putting the wrong fin in your board will result in your board and your fin fighting
  each other—usually resulting in a clumsy surf experience. First, we are going to
  talk about fin selection.  Then, we''ll touch on fin placement. When deciding which
  fin to pair with your favorite longboard, one portion of the board''s shape will
  determine what style fin you need—the tail.  (If you want to do a little extra credit,
  read The Tail Tells the Tale.)  PINTAILS For Pin Tails, or tails with a lot of curve
  to them (think: Pinwheel, Joy, Cash-Yew II, or Sano Special) you must have a fin
  with more rake.  Rake is a term for how swept-back a fin is.  See below:  The Rake
  of a fin allows the board to flow through turns, while maintaining speed.  This
  type of turn pairs with boards that have more curve in the outline of the tail. 
  For example, the curve in the outline of a pintailed longboard allows the board
  to make arcing cutbacks through the water, and this is assisted by the swept-back
  rake of a 10.5'
