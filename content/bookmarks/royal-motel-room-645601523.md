  Snelling Royal Motel Room is a photographic journey of an experimental surf trip
  and visual imagery of the east coast of Australia filmed through the lens of a Super8
  Camera.   I woke up one morning early January, and called Matt on a very spontaneous
  move, I had a conversation in my head that we had when we met a year before in Portugal,
  and it was about doing a project together, making a movie all film, all analog,
  and far away somewhere. « It''s the day » I told him, we are doing it and I wanted
  to go back to Australia because years passed since the last time I went, and I felt
  like my vision of things today would be totally different.       I knew Matt would
  be up for it and I really wanted a productive and visionary trip, I  counted on
  his hyper activity and him and I have a very sharing vision of things concerning
  photography and art culture, we complete each other a lot in that way and that is
  why making this Film was so constructive for both of us.  We got our tickets within
  one week before the departure dates and packed our bags full of films and cameras.
  We first landed in Noosa in a little caravan of someone''s garden it was perfect.
  Candle light, a lot of rain and humidity, no kitchen barely any internet and a lot
  of thinking and writing, we had a lead and not...it was on the go.  That week in
  Noosa was good, we got an amazing swell that led us to Double island point and filmed
  a lot there when Matt''s waterproof Super8 broke down, that was the deal, no digital
  assurance and the trip just started. After a week of seeing him trying to make it
  work shooting with it fixing it every session we decided to have a chill and leave
  the coast to try and find different inspiration and forget about it. To be honest
  we had no idea whether we had some surf footage or not at this point it was good
  or gone.       We landed in the Royal Motel of Tenterfield, a little lost town pretty
  affected by the fires as it was surrounded by burnt forests, we spent two nights
  there, taking photos, looking for good lights and finding a way to continue our
  project. It really was the highlight of the trip! I know most of our friends were
  wondering what we were doing there but it was our scene, old school Australia, cool
  people living their every day routine and a very 80''s architectural vibe, we were
  in heaven really! We drove back to the central coast, heads full of motivation and
  continued to film and fix the camera each time.    It is such a good experience
  making movie without seeing any images of what he shot the whole time, we spoke
  a lot about what we want to film and how,  he was doing it and telling me what he
  shot, all I had was my imagination. We wanted to give more than a typical surf trip
  video and I hope we did, we wanted something more cinematographic and I am super
  happy I got to work with Matt on this project, this is the fruit of a collaborative
  mind connection. Most of the music was composed by friends for the movie which was
  super important to us. I hope I get to work with Matt again in the future, I have
  got more very special projects in my mind that involve Art cinema and surf culture,
  there is a good new vision concerning surf movies and I am super excited to see
  what''s cooking in the next years.'
