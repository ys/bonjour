At the start of the pandemic, Mike Guest found himself in an unusual setting: home. After 20 years of working as a freelance photographer in outdoor environments all over the world, he had been accustomed to constantly being on the move, surrounded by athletes, clients, collaborators – and distractions.

It was during this period of personal darkness, and following a conversation with his friend and fellow surfer/photographer Nick Pumphrey, that Dawn Days was born. Every morning, Mike was up at 3.30am, pulling on his wetsuit and walking down to the beach with his camera, where he would swim out and capture the dawn.

The Ripple Effect is a beautifully open and honest reflection from Mike on how this project helped him process his mental health over the pandemic.
