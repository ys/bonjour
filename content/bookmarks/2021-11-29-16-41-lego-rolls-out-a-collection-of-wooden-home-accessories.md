Step back in time to your childhood with the help of **[LEGO Group’s](https://www.lego.com/)** first ever collection of wooden home accessories. Created in partnership with [**Room Copenhagen**](https://roomcopenhagen.com/), they’ve been designed to elevate your [home](https://shop.design-milk.com/collections/home-decor) interior space with a range of picture frames, wall hangers, book racks, and desk drawers. Each piece is manufactured from FSC-certified Red Oak, and available in a soap oak and dark stained oak finish. The neutral palette is guaranteed to fit right in to a multitude of spaces and aesthetics.

Known around the world, the LEGO Group carved its bricks from wood until 1960, when they transitioned to plastic. Aside from the 2018 launch of a Wooden Minifigure, the brand hasn’t worked with the material in over 60 years. Each of the items in the collection are assembled by hand and have been designed to scale of the original LEGO brick dimensions. Because of this, certain items, such as the desk drawers and picture frames, can be stacked!

“Room Copenhagen is well versed in creating and producing upscaled LEGO bricks for children’s storage and organization in the home and this launch takes our collaboration with the LEGO Group to the next level, in terms of expanding the product line to target adults. We trialled it with the launch of the LEGO Originals Wooden Minifigure, and the success of that product inspired us to bring out an entire range in the same material,” shared Jacob Eberhard, CEO at Room Copenhagen.
