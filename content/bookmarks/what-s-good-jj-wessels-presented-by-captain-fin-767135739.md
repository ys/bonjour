title: What's Good JJ Wessels | Presented by Captain Fin
domain: youtube.com
description: |-
  We sat down with one of our favorite free surfers JJ Wessels after a surf at his home break to chat fins, surfing as a "sport", life as a dad and more. JJ's surf clips have been a staple on Log Rap since the early days, but this was the first time we every sat down with him to chat on camera and we couldn't be happier with how the conversation turned out. Big shoutout to Captain Fin for supporting this episode of What's Good.
