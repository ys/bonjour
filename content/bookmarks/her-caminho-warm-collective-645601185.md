description: As a kid, Ines Ambrosio dreamt of being an actress and a dentist. Why
  feel obligated to choose? The first thing she wanted to learn how to draw was a
  dolphin. Years later, she became a multidisciplinary visual artist passionate about
  surfing. That couldn’t make more sense. I had a chat with the Portuguese artist
  and we talked about the importance of experimentations in arts, the balance between
  being in control and letting go, her fascination for mangos that she grows in her
  garden, and the cyanotype called the “blueprint” technique described as one of the
  earliest forms of photography.
