description: I went twenty-two years not knowing how to cook an egg. Cooking classes
  were a rough time for an anxious student like I was. I did not know I was suffering
  from anxiety at the time; that is a recent realisation. Being open about anxiety
  is a challenge. How you think, when written as a raw thought, might have undertones
  of paranoia. I was worried about cooking an egg, without knowing my exact worries.
  For other foods, my worry was always food poisioning; if I cook, I'll get ill.
