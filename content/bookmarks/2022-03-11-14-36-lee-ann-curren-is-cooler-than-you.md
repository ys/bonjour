Especially when it’s the voice of Lee-Ann Curren, the musician and surfer from Biarritz. She might be the kid of Tom Curren, but there’s no doubt she holds her own, especially aside from being genetically blessed with the natural talent to stand on top of a piece of fibreglass.

In this mini-series from her sponsor Vans, we get to see Lee-Ann create her own seven-inch vinyl with the help of her brother in California and some friends around France. There’s even a nice piece of advice at the end that will put a smile on your face… but I’ll let you watch it all the way to the end to catch that little gem for yourself.
