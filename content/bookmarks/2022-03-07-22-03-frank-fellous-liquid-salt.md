description: "Frank Fellous is a talented French-born surfer/photographer who has
  a \r\nspecial interest in California culture from the 50s to the 70s. An annual
  \r\nvisit to San Onofre, California affords Frank the unique opportunity to \r\ndocument
  today’s surf scene, and its myriad characters, with his vintage \r\nfilm Leica rangefinder.
  We spoke with Frank to learn more."
