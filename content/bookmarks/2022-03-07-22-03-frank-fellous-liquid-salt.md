Finally, a diversity of talents that I’ve met over the years at San O: Brian Bent, JJ and Nat Wessels, Andy Nieblas, Makala Smith and many more. Also Clovis Donizetti, French style master for his surfing and his friendship, always kind to share his strong knowledge in surfing culture and history and a small community of surfers, shapers, photographers, writers in Biarritz.

**What boards are you currently riding? What do you like about them? **

In California: Jim Phillips Pig, 7’10 Tyler Warren Function Hull, and a 6’10 Christenson C Bucket. In France: Lance Carson 60’s Classic Pintail, Hobie Phil Edwards, 8’0 Christenson C Bucket, 7’0 Josh Hall Egg and a 5’10 Josh Hall Keel fin fish.

Regarding my boards, I like that they are both classic and functional. They allow me to catch waves easily, make smooth turns and glide nicely, I have fun and I love my boards. I also always have a surf mat and fins with me in my van or when I travel for work or on a short trip and I can’t bring any surfboards. I just got a custom one from G-Mat that I’m really excited to try once the travel ban ends.

**Sorry but we have to ask, what is your favorite food and what are you listening to? **

I will say Japanese (sushi, soba, udon…) and Israeli food (hummus foul, sabich, falafels). As far as music, if you listen to The Rolling Stones, Townes Van Zandt, CSNY, Carole King, Lou Reed, Nina Simone, Sam Cooke and Wu Tang Clan Radios on Spotify, you can get a pretty good idea of what I like. You can also add Serge Gainsbourg to the mix.

**What's next for Frank Fellous ?**

Who knows what’s next for everyone this year? Once the lockdown ends, I'll go back to Biarritz on weekends and hopefully to California again this summer. Also, I was supposed to move to New York very soon, but all our operations in the states have been cancelled or postponed until September, so by then I hope to make the move.
