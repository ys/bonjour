— Solene Roge

1, 2, 3. First, coffee. Check outside. Grey. Cold. Humid. Bit of sun, bit of rain. Not a breeze. The Basque winter in all its glory. Maybe we’ll go surf, maybe we’ll stay here. “Marée haute, table basse.” Let me write that down, grab a book and take a seat.

3, 4, 5. You’re hungry ? Cheese and wine. La “bonne bouffe”, my old man would say. There’s no better way to start the day. And to end it, if I may. What goes in-between is for us to pick. A blank page to draw on, where coloring outside the lines should be mandatory.

6, 7 and 8. Cats everywhere. I don’t know where from but they keep appearing. Look at them. Not giving a hoot about you and me. It’s kind of funny. Wild they were, wild they’ll be. I might have been a cat in a past life. No fences, conventions or master to obey. Hero of my own story, not just for one day.

9, 10, 11. Phone’s ringing. What am I doing ? I never know what to say. Truth is, most of the time, I have no idea. I’m just here. Or there. Floating somewhere. Some could call it creating. For me, the real art is doing nothing. Things will happen if they have to. Intuition, I call it. Unconscious, maybe.

12, 13, 14. Logs on top. Gloomy bay. Not a soul, let’s go play. That’s what I meant about life, you see. Simple as ABC. Few words, few moves. Waves give the rhythm, you never really get to choose. As long as it’s groovy, keep it balanced and glide away.

15, 18 or more. I can’t remember what these numbers are about. It just felt right. “Intuition, I call it. Unconscious, maybe.” Am I quoting myself ? Why not, actually. World is what you want it to be, as absurd as it is. A mellow, messy, melting dream. Yes, that’s where you’ll find me. Barefoot, foolish and free.

**Kid of la Côte des Basques,** [**Robin Falxa**](https://www.instagram.com/robinfalxa/) **is probably one of the best longboarders around and an unclassifiable artist, behind the project** [**De NoiR**](https://www.instagram.com/_denoir_/) **with Rebeca Bayarri Olmos. We met him one of these foggy mornings at Xolomak, his family house up the hills of Guéthary, surrounded by chickens and eight cats. Through a long, chill and glassy day, we shared food and memories, from his den to the waves.**
