But Jack White must _reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeally_ like The Beatles, because he can identify a Beatles song in one second. That is, you can play him the first second of a Beatles song and he’ll be able to tell you what it is. Pretty impressive. Something tells me Kurt would’ve been faster though. Wankers don’t like to hear it but Kurt Cobain was a huge Beatles fan. I got into a fight on social media one time with a tool who thought Kurt said he liked the Beatles to be ironic. I wanted to punch this person in the head, neck and cock. Why would Kurt Cobain bother saying how much he loved The Beatles—in multiple interviews—just to be ironic? That’s just stupid. The vid above is pre-blue hair Jack, so it could be a couple of years old, but it just popped up on YouTube this week, so I thought you’d wanna see it. What are you doing after this, wanna go to Papaya King? Ok, cool.
