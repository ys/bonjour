title: SEE SAW
domain: vimeo.com
description: "The expression \"see-saw\" describes a rapid and repeated change of
  a condition, situation or position from place to the other over and over again:
  looking for waves, improving hand planes  or even editing a surf video. \nWe thought
  this was a perfect catch of the echoing of the sea conditions and everything that
  evolves around it. Back and forth.\n\nMusic composed by:\n\nTiago Perestrelo\n\nAdditional
  Film :\n \nJames Skerritt\n\nMathieau Glémarec\n\nConor Flanagan\n\nSupported by:\nFinisterre
  \nGlobe brand Europe"
