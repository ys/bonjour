domain: youtube.com
description: "Hireth is a short film by award winning Director Seth Hughes exploring
  the deep but often lost connection we have to home and our homeshores. \n\nFilmed
  on the Outer Hebrides in the Scottish Isles, Finisterre Ambassador, Mike Lay and
  Isalnder, Colin MacLeod exchange waves and reconnect with the land and waters that
  have shaped their lives so far. \n\nSet against the backdrop of the Atlantic Ocean,
  where the raw, uninterrupted swells meet the rugged beauty of the Scottish coastline,
  Seth Hughes beautifully weaves together breathtaking cinematography, landscape,
  surf and soundtrack to capture the profound link between people and place.\n\n#surfing
