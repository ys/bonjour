**Born: Johannesburg South Africa 1984.**  
Ricky only started painting full time in 2014 having his first solo show in 2015. Before this he was focused on curatorial and creative activism; founding /A WORD OF ART gallery and artist residency in addition to the Colour Ikamva school rejuvenation project in South Africa.

Ricky then became most well known for his large-scale murals that can be seen in cities all over the world but in 2015 at the age of 30 wanting to stop traveling for murals and having never studied formally, he excepted a scholarship to study classical painting at the Los Angeles Academy of figurative art with the support of the RVCA artist network program.

Dropping out after one year Ricky continued to travel for exhibitions and projects but still seeking a simpler life and studio practice he then moved again in 2019, this time to Sri Lanka to set up his dream studio and artist residency Śūnyatā**, the** focus now was his studio practice, surfing and the pursuit of all natural materials; Indigo, Charcoal, Bee wax, rust and plant dyes sourced between Bali and Sri Lanka.

His studio work has become the antithesis of his public murals as it allows for a more meditative environment to create and to explore deeper into his ideas without compromise.

### **PUBLIC ART**

With over 50 large scale murals around the world from New York to Istanbul and Madagascar to Kathmandu Ricky is inspired by his experiences in meditation and Buddhist Dharma (law of nature) and therefore now his public paintings explore the nature of non-duality and interconnectedness focusing on bringing to light relevant social issues and universal truths. His intention with his murals is to create artwork that has a connection to the people and place in which he is painting.

His achievements in public art have made it on CNN, Mail & Guardian’s ‘200 young people in SA who make a difference’, Winner of the International Art and healing network award for 2011 and National Geographic's list of ‘11 street art greats’ alongside the likes of Banksy..
