title: SHINKO, JAPAN; a tHRiViNG sci-fi surf scene
domain: youtube.com
description: "Welcome to Shinko, a unique and unexpected surf scene in Japan. A wave
  with unusual contrast- on one side, the raw, powerful energy of the ocean, and on
  the other, the industrial hum of machinery, both coexisting in this unexpected surf
  haven. \n\nI’m always excited to explore different surf spots and immerse myself
  in the unique surf cultures during my travels. Surfing Japan is not all about navigating
  through rocks like a kamikaze pilot (like my last video at God's Crack), here is
  a look at a more traditional Japanese surf scene… a sci fi looking one at that!\n\nHope
  you enjoy this journey of a very special scene in Japan. Thank you to Keito Matusuoka
  for showing us around and plugging us into your world! Without your help and guidance
  this video would not be possible. \n\nI would also like to thank Shohei Echigo for
  letting us stay at \"Hotel Shohei\". And Shohei's dad for being the first to surf
  Shinko, congratulations on discovering an ENTIRE surf scene \U0001F92F Massive thanks
  to rest of the surf community for having us :)\n\nThanks to Coby Perkovich, Shouta
  Sawada and Misaki Haberl. For assistance on translations.\n\nFilmed by: \nWade Carroll

  thanks to friends and family for the feedback you always give me prior to launching
  vids, My wife, My Mom, Dave Malcolm, Paul Daniels you all rule and would not be
  where I am without all of you in my life. \n \nThank you for watching! \n\nOther
