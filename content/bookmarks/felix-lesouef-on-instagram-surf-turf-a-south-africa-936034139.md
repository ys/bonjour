  vision of a surf adventure.  As the year draws to a close, we’ve been spending precious
  time with friends and family. After showing them the final version, we want to thank
  everyone for their positive feedback, which encouraged us to share the film with
  the rest of the world.  So here we are! We’ll probably be posting it this month,
  and we can’t wait to show you what this incredible journey looks like. Stay tuned
  for more in the coming weeks!".'
