title: Salt & Film "Lost"
domain: youtube.com
description: "16mm Short Film about surfing and surf culture on the Central Coast
  of California. \n\n\nFilmed on location: Pismo Beach, Shell Beach, Cayucos Beach
  \nSingle 100ft Kodak daylight 250D used to make this short film. This was my first
  attempt at 16mm and my newly purchased Bolex Rex 3 camera. I adapted a M42 mount
  35mm Pentax lens using the M42 to Bolex screw mount adapter from Amazon. I have
  since shot more film with the Bolex and all film is processed through Pro8mm.com
  I highly \nrecommend them for all 16mm and 8mm processing and scanning. \n\nGear:
  Bolex 16mm Film Camera (REX 3), Kodak 250D Daylight Film Stock, Zoom PodTrak P4
  (Audio Recorder), Sure SM7B (Mic)."
