**CURRENT PRODUCTION TIMES 1-2 WEEKS**

#### [**Sizing Guide**](https://cleversupply.co/pages/sizing-guide)

A great camera strap option for those that prefer a more minimal carry, yet all the flexibility of the quick-release Anchor Strap. This strap is 3/4" all the way through, and is made the same way as the Anchor Camera strap, just without the neckpiece.

Each strap starts with high-quality full-grain leather, which is tanned in the USA. We use leathers with a medium temper that ensure comfort on first use with a “broken-in” feel.

Both traditional Film SLR or DSLR cameras from or Nikon work great with this strap, as well as any Leica, Fujifilm, Sony mirrorless cameras.

**Peak Design Anchors** For this camera strap we're using hardware from Peak Design, who has a long history in innovative quick-release products. This is a great choice for someone interested in other Peak Design products, or someone already invested in their ecosystem.

**Specs:**

• Designed to mount to most camera systems

• High-quality Full-grain Leather

 • Secured with either Military grade waxed polycord thread or Solid Brass Black Rivets

• Peak Design Anchor Links  ( _Anchors each hold over 200lbs (90kg) and feature extreme abrasion-resistance._)

Straps can be made between 34"-54" (40" is the most popular length).
