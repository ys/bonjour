description: "Welcome to Breaking Waves, a series shining a light on often overlooked
  and polarizing social issues and topics within surfing. In this inaugural episode,
  Vans pro surfer and Weird Waves host Dylan Graves explores the stereotypical perceptions
  that often exist within surf culture, as he seeks to learn more about the LGBTQ+
  surf community and understand how surfers can become better allies. Follow along
  on Dylan’s journey as he links up with San Francisco’s Queer Surf—an organization
  advocating to create safe spaces at the beach and in the water— and explores how
  to make surfing more welcoming to everyone.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/1aIFFTY\n\nAbout
