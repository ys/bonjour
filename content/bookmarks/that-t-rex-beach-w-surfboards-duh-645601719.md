description: "Would you keep walking down a steep trail toward a pounding shore break
  if someone drops a \"you might die out there\" as you walk passed?  It almost had
  us...\nLuckily for your viewing entertainment we followed through with our plan
  of surfing down at the iconic Kelinking Beach, after getting a tip from a friend
  that it might be worth a shot. One of the steepest trails I've ever walked down
  (and back up), but well worth it for the breath taking views along the way and the
  pristine beach waiting for you at the bottom. Throw some thumping shore pound in
  the mix and you got a recipe for a really good time. Hope you enjoy our experience,
  let me know what you think in the comments below :) \n-Dylan\n\nProduced\nEdited\nOrignal
