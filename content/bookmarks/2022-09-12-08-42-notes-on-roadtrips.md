**1\.** My father loves to tell the story about when he drove the same route as a kid with his father through the Mojave. It was 1968, the family moved from British Columbia back east. The two of them peeled off in my grandfather’s 63’ MG Coup for an impromptu detour to Fort Huachuca,📌  the Arizona cavalry camp where he grew up. 

As he tells it, his father had a thing for stockpiling sea water, insisting they stop at each coastal town and overlook to collect some. He used the bevy of glass jars he brought along with him whenever he knew he’d be close to the ocean. Then every morning when back in New York, splash the water on his face. 

Their other substantial stop was the Southern California Mattress Company, the intent to outfit the backseat of the coup into a makeshift camper van. It was a technique he’d perfected on summer trips out to the Jersey Shore. The two of them could take turns driving and the other, if needed, could get a bit of ‘shut eye.’ Mind you, my father was thirteen at the time.

I say this all to paint the picture: mattress in the back seat, glass jars clinking. Thirteen-year-old at the wheel. When I envision it, I envision Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but in some alternative universe, more sober, less debaucherous but barreling just as fast through the desert in high summer to the heart of the American dream. 

**2\.** His favorite bit to retell is how it all came to an abrupt halt halfway down Route 66, in the middle of the Mojave when he woke up from his ‘backseat nap’ in horror to a yellow-stained mattress and soaked jeans. “Age thirteen I could drive solo down the Pacific Coast Highway but couldn’t make it through the desert without a pitstop.” 

It was hot and the sun showed no sign of abating. They were miles from the closest waystation. The only way forward was to yank the mattress from the back seat onto the side of the road. My grandfather splashed the precious sea water to wash it down and used the shirt off his back to mop up any excess. 

When there was nothing more to do but wait for the mattress to bake dry in the sun, he lit a cigarette, handed another to my father, and turned on the radio. 

“Don’t apologize, kiddo. We’re on the road together, that means we’re on the hook for each other.” 

**3\.** The point of this story is not to get hung up on the corporate equivalent of wetting the bed in the middle of the Mojave. The point, and why I like this story so much, is that it gets at the _interconnectedness_ of being on the road with other people. Or in our case, the proximity that comes along with building something new together. 

It necessitates a specific type of ownership. One in which your number one priority is the collective even more so than your own work. That is, making others better. Not to the detriment of your own work, but with the mind that a rising tide lifts all boats. This isn’t a zero sum game.

**4\.** I find it most helpful to think about a ‘social contract’ you enter into with those you’re working with. 

On one hand, it’s the respect you give. Being ‘on the hook for the team’ means having a certain dedication to the potential in other people, specifically a desire to help it grow. 

Explicitly, this looks like being direct and honest in your communication, especially when it’s not easy. As anything otherwise would be a disservice. It’s helping others see in themselves what they can’t see. Areas for growth, but also yet-to-be discovered talent. Your imperative is to uncover it, then get them behind the wheel and when it’s time, put a foot on the gas.

**5\.** To say it outright, even the most talented person in the world won’t do well here if they don’t have an interest in helping other people grow and succeed. The question you will be held most accountable for isn’t “how have you gotten better” it's “how did you make someone else better?” Better yet, how have you made the collective, the team, better?

**6\.** You also won’t do well if you’re not willing to give other people large amounts of creative freedom. Because that’s what you get in return: large amounts of creative freedom to fill glass jars with seawater and retrofit 68’ coups into camper vans. That’s what people need to do their best work. 

**7\.** ‘On the hook’ is never meant to be punitive or imply any sense of preordained blame.

It’s just another thing, like heartfelt intensity, that's hard to teach and more often comes ‘baked in.’  That proactive instinct to pull your weight, to ‘do your homework,’ and contribute to whatever needs to be done for the success of the whole and those around you. 

That said, ‘on the hook for the team’ is at its best and most honest when it means we see each other not just as colleagues but as people. And, when needed, put ourselves on the hook for one another in that dimension just as much. 

**‍**At the end of the day, the product we’re actually building here is each other.
