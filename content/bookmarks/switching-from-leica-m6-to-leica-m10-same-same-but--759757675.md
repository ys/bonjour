title: 'Switching from Leica M6 to Leica M10: same same but different?'
domain: youtube.com
description: "The Leica M6 has been my main camera for the last 4,5 years and I have
  easily shot over 250 rolls with it. Ever since getting the Leica M10 in summer last
  year, I get quite a few messages and questions about my shooting experience and
  my decision when I shoot which camera. Therefore, in this video I want to tell you
  about my experiences and my observations after around 9 months with the M10. Special
