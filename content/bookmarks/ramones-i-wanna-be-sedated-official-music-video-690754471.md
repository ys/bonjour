  Lyrics:
  Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
  I wanna be sedated
  Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
  I wanna be sedated

  Just get me to the airport, put me on a plane
  Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
  I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
  Oh no-o-o-o-o

  Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
  I wanna be sedated
  Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
  I wanna be sedated

  Just put me in a wheelchair, get me on a plane
  Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
  I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
  Oh no-o-o-o-o

  Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
  I wanna be sedated
  Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
  I wanna be sedated

  Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
  Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco
  I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
  Oh no-o-o-o-o

  Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
  I wanna be sedated
  Nothing to do nowhere to go-o-oh
  I wanna be sedated

  Just put me in a wheelchair, get me to the show
  Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go loco
  I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes
  Oh no-o-o-o-o

  Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
  Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
  Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
  Ba ba baba, baba ba baba, I wanna be sedated
