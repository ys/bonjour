  Well, I bought a TLR for the first time. It's a Yashica Mat LM that I got off Ebay for $150, and in this video I have no clue if it works at all. It shoots medium format film in a 6x6, and is super fun for both portraits and landscapes. The dogs and I hop in Big Green and drive into the woods to meet our friend McKenna to take some portraits and drink some coffee. Shooting Portra 800 film of course, with scans by State Film Lab, my absolute favorite lab that I have been using, going on 7 years now.
