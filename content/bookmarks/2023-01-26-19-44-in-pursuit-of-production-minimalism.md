title: In Pursuit of Production Minimalism
description: While working at Lockheed during the cold war, Kelly Johnson was reported
  to have coined KISS ("keep it simple, stupid"); a principle that suggests glibly
  that systems should be designed to be as simple as possible. While complexity is
  never a conscious design goal of any project, it arises inherently as new features
  are pursued or new components are introduced.
