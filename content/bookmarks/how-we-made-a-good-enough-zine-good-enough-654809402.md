title: How We Made A Good Enough Zine — Good Enough
domain: goodenough.us
description: "We made a zine!\nThe first issue was released in August, and I finished
  the second issue just last week. Right now, a hundred copies are on their way from
  the printer to me (update: they've just arrived!). Today I'd like to share the story
  of how this zine came about.\nBad Idea: Zine\nA Good Enough Zine was one of our
  bad ideas. On May 11, 2023, Arun suggested:\n\n  \n\nMy initial reaction: What a
  terrible idea!\nWhy so terrible? Because making a zine is a sh*t ton of work. (I
  know—I've made several issues of a comics zine, and it is a lot of work!) And really,
  who's reading zines these days and who cares about what we're doing at Good Enough?"
