title: Surfing Isn't Productive
domain: almondsurfboards.com
description: Surfing is not productive, in that there is no tangible output of the
  time and effort spent surfing ocean waves. Other hobbies yield beautiful, if not
  clumsy and messy results. A potter makes a clay pot, a painter paints a canvas,
  a musician writes a song, a fisherman catches fish (either to be released or for
  the frying pan), but surfing's fruit is purely internal. All the years spent in
  the water, checking weather reports, loading gear, getting to the beach, paddling
  for waves, missing waves, making sections, kicking out at the end of an unexpectedly
  long one... they're just moments.  And hopefully the sum result of all those moments
  is a happier, healthier, more patient version of each of us. The ice cream headaches,
  humbling moments, and rare moments of triumph over something far more powerful than
  ourselves has to equate to something of significance.  I was talking to an acquaintance
  recently—I wish I could say friend because he's someone who I admire greatly—and
  he was talking about how healing surfing has been recently, a way to connect with
  his sons after a long, hard season. As he was talking, it occurred to me that his
  experience with surfing, and the value he is getting from it is vastly different
  than my own. Which is really what got me thinking
