​

#NotT00Late is a project to invite newcomers to the climate movement, as well as provide climate facts and encouragement for people who are already engaged but weary. We believe that the truths about the science, the justice-centered solutions, the growing strength of the climate movement and its achievements can help. They can assuage the sorrow and despair, and they can help people see why it’s worth doing the work the climate crisis demands of us.

​

We know that there are still important choices to make about climate, and we don't have to wait hoping for national politicians to act. We know individual actions matter, but in order to have effective change it will take mass action from people everywhere. We know the difference between the best and worst case scenarios matters. We know that the future is being decided in the present. We know that a lot of people are overwhelmed by doom and gloom. It is not too late. At the same time, we are not here to avoid the worst news. We are here to fortify people to face it and to try to change it.

We also believe that some of the challenging emotions we feel about the planet's climate stem from commonly held frameworks about how change works, where power resides, and what possibility looks like, and we are here to think with you about those as well. Our goal is to offer good news, perspectives,  voices, connections to people, as well as good paths forward for the climate and those who care about it.

We're serious when we say it's not too late. If you have questions, we have some answers.

If you're trying to figure out where to start, here are 3 simple paths to get you going:

​

INFORM

Make sure you're reading beyond the horrifying headlines. Fill yourself with the real facts about where we're at. Check out the FAQ or the articles below as a good start. The more you start looking for stories of hope, action and solutions - the more likely you'll then see them everywhere. If you find a climate story that brings you hope, share it on your social media using #NotTooLate 

​

IMAGINE

Take time to imagine what the world could like. Imagine what your city/town could look like if there was healthy air and strong communities. Imagine what justice could look like. Imagine if strong changes happened now. [What could it look like?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9uTH0iprVQ)

ACT

While adapting our individual patterns does matter, to really build change at the scale we need requires us to act together. Find a climate organization in your town/state/nation and get involved. Cross that awkward line of being the new person in a group and just join in. If there isn't one in your area already, then find the courage to start something.

​

​

We'll be adding more resources on the website in the future. For now here's some good places to start if you want to learn more.

"So, when scrolling through your social media feed, share and amplify the messages you believe the world needs to hear. Who knows—maybe it’ll surge like a waterfall and change the hearts and minds of enough people to positively alter the future. That’s an incredible responsibility. I hope we use it wisely." - [Leah Thomas](https://atmos.earth/social-media-culture-intersectional-environmentalism/)

Not Too Late isn't an organization.

Our goal is to provide useful perspectives and information and guide people from despair to possibilities.

This is a project led by Rebecca Solnit and Thelma Young Lutunatabua.
