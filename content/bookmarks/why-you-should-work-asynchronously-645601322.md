title: Why you should work asynchronously
domain: ben.balter.com
description: Asynchronous work allows for remote work thatâ€™s enjoyable and that actually
  works. Async increases inclusivity, produces better outcomes faster, encourages
  discoverability and permanence of context, creates space for learning, shifts knowledge
  workers to higher value work, improves work-life balance, empowers distributed teams,
  and enables parallelization and flow.
