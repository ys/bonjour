title: 380 - Sick of Your Own Work? How to Make Work You Love Again in 5 Steps REPLAY
  — CREATIVE PEP TALK
description: "This episode originally aired May 12, 2021. Do you ever look over your
  \r\nportfolio or back catalog of work and just feel sick of it all? Do you fear
  \r\nyour work is irrelevant? It’s easy in times like these to rush to making \r\nnew
  stuff that’s on trend, but in this episode I want to introduce you to a \r\nsolution
  that is essentially the opposite of that.\r\n\r\nIn this episode we talk about:\r\n\r\n
  \   * How to get in touch with the invisible thread running through your\r\n      work\r\n\r\n
  \   * Why priming yourself with the right inspiration before making work is\r\n
  \     essential and how to do it\r\n\r\n    * The practice that separates good art
  and transcendent work\r\n\r\n    * How to learn to hit your creative target more
  often\r\n\r\n    * The trick of taking your best work and riffing on it"
