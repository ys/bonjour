  talk title: Being glue\n\nYour job title says \"software engineer\", but you seem
  to spend most of your time in meetings. You'd like to have time to code, but nobody
  else is onboarding the junior engineers, updating the roadmap, talking to the users,
  noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and
  making sure that everyone's going roughly in the same direction. If you stop doing
  those things, the team won't be as successful. But now someone's suggesting that
  you might be happier in a less technical role. If this describes you, congratulations:
  you're the glue. If it's not, have you thought about who is filling this role on
  your team?\n\nEvery senior person in an organisation should be aware of the less
  glamorous - and often less-promotable - work that needs to happen to make a team
  successful. Managed deliberately, glue work demonstrates and builds strong technical
  leadership skills. Left unconscious, it can be extremely career limiting. It pushes
  people into less technical roles and even out of the industry.\n\nLet's talk about
  how to allocate glue work deliberately, frame it usefully and make sure that everyone
  is choosing a career path they actually want to be on.\n\nAbout Tanya Reilly\nTanya

  and site reliability. Before Squarespace she spent 12 years in Site Reliability
