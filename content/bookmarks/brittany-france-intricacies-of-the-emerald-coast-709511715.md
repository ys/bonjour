title: BRITTANY, FRANCE; intricacies of the emerald coast
domain: m.youtube.com
description: "Thanks to a social media post, I connected with Ian Fountain and some
  of the locals in Brittany, France for a big winter storm.  Brittany is the largest
  French peninsula in the NW of France and one of the hardest coasts to score, due
  to it’s massive tides, translating to short surf windows… \nCombine that with nearly
  2000 miles of coastline, that’s a tough shoe to polish… \nSo why come here? \nBy
  now I hope you have a gist for my taste in waves and surf trips… \nAnd I definitely
  enjoy the going off the beaten path, especially when it comes to surf trips. \nI
  had always gone to South west France… \nSo with interesting charts lighting up the
  north \nI thought… \nWhat would it take to score waves in Brittany??\n\nFilmed by
  : \nPaul Daniels\nGaeton Duque\n\nEdit, Music, GFX by your truly"
