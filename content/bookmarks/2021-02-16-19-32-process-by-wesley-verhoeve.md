Dear Friends,

This week I’ll share the three pieces of advice that come up most often when I do portfolio reviews.

Also, we’re also giving away the very last copy of Rosie Matheson’s sold out and very gorgeous and massive Boys Magazine.

One of the things I love most about photography is that there is always more to learn. As long as you stay curious and dedicated, there will be opportunity to improve forever. Photography is a never-ending craft.

Portfolio reviews are a great way to improve. Photographers whose work you admire can share technical insights and process tips, but don’t only show your work to other photographers.

Watching non-photographers view your work can bring valuable insight unburdened by any photography training. Sometimes that’s even more valuable. In the end that’s who you want to move with your work after all.

With every round of feedback we gain little bits of awareness that will help us see differently, document more elegantly, and tell better stories.

Below are the three pieces of feedback that come up most often when I hold portfolio reviews. Italian photographer and Process reader [Lorenzo Martinoia](http://www.instagram.com/shootitandsee)’s was kind enough to let me share some of his work and the comments from our review session.

Decide which part of the image is your main subject before pushing your shutter button. The viewer should know right away what they’re supposed to look at. Your composition should lead their eyes to the most important part of the photo.

If it’s a portrait of a person, that’s easy, the viewer will usually be led to the eyes or face. If it’s a cityscape or a still life, you can still think of the image as a portrait. Just not of a human.

For example, in Lorenzo’s photo on the left notice the leading lines that take us by the hand and bring our eyes to the door in the back. The colorful laundry is a secondary subject whose lines also lead us to the door. It’s a beautiful clear image that would be lovely in a travel piece. This photo works as a portrait of a charming street scene.

On the right side however, my eyes feel nervous as they search for a subject to land on. Is it a portrait of the woman? Well, she’s in the shade and her face is turned away. Our eyes generally follow the light, which means we land on the top half of the building in the center. So is that our subject? Hmm just not very clear and therefor a less strong image. Not a portrait of anything really.

Unless you’re intentionally going for a chaotic feel or lots of tension, try to compose for calmness and watch your lines.

For our example, let’s look at the image on the left, which has a very simple composition. Some photographers may crop in further, which is a valid choice, but it is a balanced, pleasing, and beautifully metered image, requiring no extra work from our eyes.
