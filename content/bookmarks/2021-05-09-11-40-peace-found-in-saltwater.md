Sometimes I was organised. I’d check the tide times before I went go to bed, knowing that when the sun rose, the little bay at the mouth of the estuary would be full, buoys bobbing in the gentle current, watched over by sleepy coast guard cottages and protected by the disused life boat station. On these mornings when my mind was calm and my mood was light I’d bring my ruck-sack packed with wool mittens, a dry hat and a flask of tea. Accompanied by my black dog I’d park outside the farm at the end of the single track road. The morning light just breaking through the low winter cloud and spilling slowly out over the river. Frost crunching beneath foot and paw we would make our way down to the sanctuary of our bay.

The hardest part, of course, is getting in. Leaving my muddy boots on the slipway and my dungarees and soft roll neck safely stowed in my backpack, I tiptoe down the boat launch to where the water lapped at the uneven concrete. Deep breath, first foot in, followed by the second. I let the breath out involuntarily as Nica takes up her sentry position at the waters edge. Taking more deep, calming breaths I wade further out into the stillness and safety of the natural harbour. The moment before taking the plunge is always the longest. Every single time, as the water reaches my thighs, I consider not doing it. I could just turn around, my swimming costume still dry, pull my fluffy socks back on and stay warm and cosy. But I am fully aware that this is the hard part and I almost bask in the knowledge that I’ll overcome it. Taking another deep breath as the icy water stings my bare skin and the pale sun slips like oil across the sea’s surface, I drop into the deep. The water is so cold it burns, pushing the air out of my lungs. My body goes into autopilot and I start ploughing towards the pink buoys in front crawl, clawing at the water with my hands, want-ing to get around the floating markers and back out of the sea as quickly as possible. My breath is ragged and the water splashes everywhere, disturbing the peace of the dawn. But I force my-self to regain control. Deep breaths, breast stroke. Calming my inhales and exhales I go into my self titled ‘zen monk’ mode and slow everything down. I head towards the white buoy on the opposite side of the bay, breathing slowly, swimming slowly. Floating on my back I watch the sun rise over the estuary, listen to the sound of the trawlers heading back from their nights work, feel the cold water wash over my freckly skin, relish in the inability for anyone to disturb me; no phone, no friends, no clients. There is nothing but me, Ni and the sea.
