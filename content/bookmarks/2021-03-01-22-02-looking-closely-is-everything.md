# Looking Closely is everything

> Then sneak out of bed, make a beeline for that pillow, and just sit and pay attention — to the weight of your body, how your shoulders fall, the tension in your face — as you closely observe that nose air. Is it hot? Is it cool? Does it come out of both nostrils? Just one? Neither? Are you stuffed? Is it pollen season? Why did they plant so many cedars post-war here in Japan? Our eyes are closed, but burning, those damn cedars, wh— oh right, we’re supposed to be focused on our breath. Can you control which nostril the air comes out of? Do you feel the follicles on your upper lip being tickled by the breath? How long can you keep focus on that part of the body? You’ll lose focus. That’s OK. Those stupid cedars will be billowing out pollen upon your world like the pheromones of leopards in heat. Forget the leopards. Bring the mind back to where the air is moving. Note your posture again, the weight of your body sinking in to the floor. Keep that in mind.
