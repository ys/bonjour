title: January Update — Yonder
description: Hi everyone! We hope you had a good Christmas and New Years and have
  had the opportunity to get into the sea for a surf or a dip. We thought we’d share
  a little bit about what’s been going on and is going on with Yonder currently. Get
  comfy, put the kettle on…this is an overdue mega-post.
