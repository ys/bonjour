  your hands on our Essential guide to your living room.\n\nLocated in a small peaceful
  town one hour south of Kyoto, the single story House in Heguri is a simple, minimalist
  home for a family of 5. Designed by Yousaka Tsusumi from Arbol Design, the striking
  exterior features 4 towering wooden sliding doors that extend to both ends of the
  site, and individually open or close depending on how the family wants to use the
  space. When opened the doors reveal a house clad in galvanised steel with plenty
  of access to the outdoors, including a covered porch area at the entrance used by
  the family as a  year-round outdoor living space. The central living and dining
  area are raised on a wooden platform and connect to the kitchen via a large, cleverly
  designed kitchen island/ dining table with different seating heights on either side.
  A series of internal  sliding doors branch off the central living space to the home’s
  two bedrooms and utility zone, which includes a separate toilet, bathroom and large
  laundry. \n\n\n#smallapartment #architecture #interiordesign \n\n\nEps 134.\nProject
