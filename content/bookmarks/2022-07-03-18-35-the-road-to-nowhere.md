The following morning, we woke early in anticipation of what was to come. Head high waves peeled across the bay, groomed by a light offshore breeze. The set up felt like a dream… A 20-meter paddle out from the beach to the take-off zone. Catch a wave. Surf it 200 meters across the bay. Walk back up the beach only to repeat again and again and again. With no phone signal and the distractions of modern life removed, we quickly settled into a new daily routine; driven by the elements with nature providing our stimulus. Our month here was perpetually filled with fishing, surfing, and cooking. We surfed this wave at all tides, winds, and swells. In the middle of the desert, it almost began to feel like we had created a new community and home for ourselves.

Nonetheless, we embarked on this trip to explore the most remote, isolated areas of Baja and the pull of the unknown soon drove us onwards. We had spoken to some Baja old timers, they told us tales of a right-hand sand pointbreak, which had the potential to produce minute long rides. The spot would be the furthest we had travelled into Baja’s wild west. A two-hour drive quickly turned into a four-hour 4x4 off-road mission. Just as our fuel gauge started to wildly dip, a large crescent shaped bay loomed in the distance. Pulling off the track, we drove along the beach until we reached a small, deserted fish camp sheltered by the headland. A couple of fishermen were packing up a panga. They informed us the lobster season had just finished and so we would be completely alone. 50km from the nearest town, nobody for miles. It felt slightly unnerving, but also exciting. Coyotes roamed the beach. Dolphins played in the surf and whales breached just beyond the bay. Low tide provided the opportunity to find dinner. With clams hiding in the tide line just beneath the sand and mussels covering the rocks. The wave itself was small, never getting above waist high. However, the minute long rides soon made up for that. Providing sections for long nose rides, and smooth cutbacks. We lived here for four beautiful days until the swell began to fade, and our minds turned to the journey south.

Living nomadically across the Baja peninsula, surfing some of the best waves of our lives. Surrounded by nature. Stripped back living. A humbling experience. Baja provided an opportunity to reflect on our priorities, and question what we truly need to be happy.
