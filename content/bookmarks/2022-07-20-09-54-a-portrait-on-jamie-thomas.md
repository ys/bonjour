From the outside looking in, it would appear as though Jamie Thomas always had his shit together. Notoriously disciplined and driven, few have left an indelible mark in skateboarding like the Chief. As a pro skater, filmer, editor, brand builder, entrepreneur, and designer, Jamie has built a legacy on being meticulous, laser focused, and detail-oriented that hasn’t been matched since his meteoric rise to the top. If you grew up skating in the ’90s or 2000s, there’s a very solid chance that Jamie was your favorite skater and Zero was your favorite brand. Hell, even Graham Coxon, guitarist of Blur, wrote a song called [“Jamie Thomas”](https://genius.com/Graham-coxon-jamie-thomas-lyrics) at the height of their collective fame.

Now approaching 50 with a new perspective on balance and life, Jamie reflects on his decades of experience, acknowledging that his obsessiveness was actually a self-destructive coping mechanism—a fatal flaw preventing him from being the well rounded family man he’s become today. That’s isn’t to say he’s not still completely obsessed with everything he does. It’s just that he’s learned to compartmentalize his time in order to live a more balanced and fulfilled life.

Don’t think you’ll see him slow down anytime soon, though. As he says, “I don’t really think about retirement. I don’t want to just sit somewhere. That sounds like purgatory. I just want to keep learning and growing.” Without further ado, we’re proud to present _A Portrait on Jamie Thomas_, a short film about Jamie in 2022. The good, the bad, the Chief.
