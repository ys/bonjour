Hey folks, I am Yannick.
I quite like our planet and I like telling stories and capturing some moments.
I am sort of a minimalist that loves to collect things. I try to live a slow life down here in Finistere.

We started a great project with Clo√©, my wonderful wife. You should go check [@douarenn](https://instagram.com/douarenn) or just check [douarenn.fr](https://douarenn.fr). It is orchestrated by Clo√© and I just do my best to help her as much as I can. It is gonna be dope.

I am mostly shooting film lately. I love waiting for the rolls to come back from [my favorite lab](https://morifilmlab.com). I shoot a lot of Portra 400 but I enjoy other kind too. The current price of Portra might be part of this.

Current gear:
- [Olympus XA](/olympus-xa)
- Leica M6 with a summarit 35mm
- [Nikonos V](/nikonos-v) with a 35mm

I stopped thinking about home scans thans to my great relationship with Mori.

I got my first longboard this year. a 9'6" pig shapped by [Mimosa](https://mimosa-surfboards.com). I got it from [Hugo Crescent](https://instagram.com/hugo_crescent). But I am still a kook. But at least a kook with a damn good looking board.

I am writing a [small letter in french](/bonjour) about all and nothing every two weeks. It is quite delightful. It forces me to write on a regular basis. I don't have many readers but they respond to those letters. So that makes me happy.

I love a good cup of coffee. Using v60, Kalita or aeropress. My heart says stop but I keep drinking it. We got an espresso machine cause it is hard to get a good flat white around here but my latte art sucks.

üñ® ‚Üí Prints come from [Ooblik](https://ooblik.com) & [N√©gatif+](https://negatifplus.com). I just printed [my first zine](/shop/a-thousand-tides) with [Ex Why Zed](https://exwhyzed.co.uk) but it is sold out right now.
