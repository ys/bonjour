Hey folks, I am Yannick.

I like to tell stories and take pictures.
I quite like our planet too and am kind of considering myself as a micro activist.

I love the ocean and nature. Lately, I only do film photography. I have an iPhone 12 mini for all the rest. I mostly load Kodak Portra 400 but Kodak Tri-X 400 is kind of growing on me.

Current gear:
- [Olympus XA](/en/olympus-xa)
- Leica M6 with a summarit 35mm
- [Nikonos V](/en/nikonos-v) with a 35mm

I started to take some [watershots](/en/nikonos-glaz) with the Nikonos. Salty water is a hell of a drug. I plan to have my own longboard also this year.
I bought gear to scan negatives at home. I got a Fuji X-T30 just for that and I should write some words about that soon. I still prefer the simplicity of lab scans.

I am writing a [small letter in french](/bonjour) about all and nothing every two weeks. It is quite delightful. It forces me to write on a regular basis. I don't have many readers but they respond to those letters. So that makes me happy.

I keep getting in better shape to surf well. Sport becomes slowly an habit. After stopping sodas 5 years ago, I also had a few months without alcohol and it felt great. I might do it again.

## Favorites

üì∑ ‚Üí Negatives get developed and scanned mostly by [Mori Film Lab](https://morifilmlab.com).

‚òïÔ∏è ‚Üí Most of my coffee beans comes from [Mok Coffee](https://mokcoffee.be). But I still like to try new roasters
