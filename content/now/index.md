## Currently, I am: 
- Trying to create a [membership](https://ko-fi.com/bonjouryannick/tiers) that would have a tangible world presence.
- Wondering if I should get a Leica M typ 262 or a M10-p
- Trying to get my kids school to keep all their classes and not have one closed.
- Figuring out how to best approach brands for shooting for them
- Reading Black Water last tome.
- Listening to the latest Green Day and Blink 182, on repeat
- Exploring more NPR Tiny Desk concerts
- Moved to [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) for my mastodon account. Find me at [@yannick](https://social.lol/@yannick)
