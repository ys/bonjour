Bonjour, my name is Yannick.  
I am a **documentary style photographer based in Finistère, France**.  
I love to capture the [beautiful, **seemingly ordinary details**](/portfolio), to highlight the small gestures of daily life and more simply **lives as they happen**.  
I often wander with a camera, a pencil and/or a small notebook.

I do enjoy [telling stories](/posts), [capturing moments](/daily) & [reading books](/books).  
I occasionaly write a [newsletter about random stuff](/bonjour) in french, or print [zines and pictures](/shop).
I also write [silly Haikus](/haikus) or send [a picture per week](/details).  

I would love to hear more about your projects, do not hesitate to [Contact me](mailto:hello@yannickschutz.com)
