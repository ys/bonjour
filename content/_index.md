Bonjour, my name is Yannick.
I am a documentary style photographer based in Finistère, France.

I love to capture the beautiful, seemingly ordinary details, to highlight the small gestures of daily life and more simply lives as they happen.

I enjoy documenting the lives of passionate people, products, or companies that align with my values. I offer you a simple and authentic perspective. An opportunity to capture the emotions you wish to share.
For your editorial photography, photo reports, products documentaries, life portraits, or things, bonjour.
