I am a **photographer** doing editorial, documentary & lifestyle photography. Based in FinistÃ¨re, France.  

I love telling simple stories. I capture slices of life on film. My work focuses on human portraits, travel serendipities, and the ocean. If I could, I would spend my days on beaches surfing and photographing people and their lives with my film camera.  

[**ðŸ’Œ Contact me**](mailto:hello@yannickschutz.com) me, I would love to hear more about your projects.
