Yannick likes to [write](/en/posts), to take [pictures](/en/series), to read [books](/en/books) and to send a [small letter in french](/bonjour) every two weeks and to send a [photo](/en/details) every wednesday. He also like to print [small set of his favorite pictures](/en/shop).

I like to write about stuff I like. From 📷 to ☕️ and also books, micro activism, respecting our 🌍 and our life in Brittany.

Those small projects bring me joy and I hope to create some more this year. Be ready!
