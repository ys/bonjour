May is perfect for Log Fest. Gwidel is renowned for its waves. 
And our friends down there made sure to create an inclusive and fun log fest.
One thing they are doing well also is making sure that people hear some Breton while you are around.
I was there one of the days to document the surf heats happening and the good vibes on the beach.
I wished I had more time to go to their Fest Noz. A traditionnal party like Bretons can throw.
