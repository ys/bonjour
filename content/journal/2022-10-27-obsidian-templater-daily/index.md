## Obsidian: Adding weather and geoloc to Daily notes

I am migrating all my notes from Day One to Obsidian.
But I found myself missing that small extra part of day weather and address.
I don't know why but I enjoy that part in every note, seeing the weather and some daily information.

So I wanted to recreate it in Obsidian. But I didn't know how to get all of that in JS. 
Luckily, [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/tag/obsidian/) made this amazing [small plugin](https://github.com/macstories/obsidian-shortcut-launcher) that allows you to launch Shortcuts from Obsidian.
I also added the plugin to use [advanced URIs](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) to modify on callback.

And voil√†,

{{< video src="weather-daily" type="video/mp4" preload="auto" >}}

My template has `@weather` in it, that gets replaced by this shortcut on the callback.
Basically works with the active file, so no need of the daily, it works with all your files.
Add `@weather` trigger the shortcut and there you go.

This was a fun small experiment to do.

So basically, my daily template looks like this:

```
...
# <% tp.file.title %>

@weather


<%* await app.commands.executeCommandById("obsidian-shortcut-launcher:weather") %>
...
```

And you can find the shortcut here: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/eee6ef8f8182430aabfb0abc0464930d

You probably want to change the vault name in the callback URL.
