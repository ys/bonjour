A few good portraits. <br/>I came for the minimalism, stayed for the stories.<br/>I laughed and enjoyed the historical touches.<br/><br/>I don’t think I like the almost condescending tone it can come around for current minimalists but I definitively liked the lesson on the sources of this movement.
