I just finished this book... it leaves me with a strange feeling. I skipped the glossaries for the first read as I am non native speaker I wanted to read the « book »parts. The author is amazingly precise in the terms. The story of the people seen through the author eyes just makes me want to be outdoor and feel what they feel. See how they see. This book is a marvelous piece of art I will for sure read again in the future. All the references contained in this book just filled my « to read » list for the next year. I am so happy I read it.
