It is summer time, you wanna read something but you don't know what. Don't worry, I got you covered.

I really enjoy reading books lately. It is often somehow related to nature when it is not a technical book. and I wanted to share a quick few recommendations with y'all. I love books so expect more of these. I challenged myself to read 35 books and keep track on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/vadrouilles).

Here are three good recommendations.

## [The eight mountains](https://amzn.to/32l2uhH) by Paolo Cognetti

This is a really good book recommended by [Martin Dellicour](http://www.martindellicour.be). This is the story of friendship in the Italian mountains. A friendship that evolves around old stones and mountain's time. 
It is also a good story around loneliness. And a story about a father and a son, in a way. Which resonated a lot with me when I read it.

I would also suggest another one by Paolo Cognetti, the [wild boy](https://amzn.to/30nu4JA). The story also takes place in the Italian mountains.

## [Indian Creek Chronicles: A winter alone in the Wilderness](https://amzn.to/2G7RwTx) by Pete Fromm

One of the first nature writing book I read. The story of a student spending its whole winter in a tent. His only job is to watch after salmon's eggs that need to survive through the winter. 

Another great story of man vs the loneliness of wilderness. Highly recommended. There is [a sequel](https://amzn.to/2xOpI1D) to this one where he is now a father. And hoped to bring his kids with him. 
Both are true stories.

## [The Dharma Bums](https://amzn.to/2GaveAn) by Jack Kerouac

Another great part of its live. Part spiritual, part outdoors. A Buddhist experience where we follow Kerouac’s alter ego, Ray Smith, between the mountains and the jazz clubs. 

I loved reading most of Kerouac's stories. I like the writing style and personal experience mixed with fictional moments. 

I would love to hear what you enjoyed reading lately. Don't hesitate to share it with me.
