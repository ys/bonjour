I ended 2019 by reading [Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.fr/Digital-Minimalism-Living-Better-Technology/dp/0241341132) by Cal Newport. This allows me to reflect on my way of using technology pretty well, more specifically that small buzzing thing in my pocket.

I really love the idea to be less addict to that interruption machine, giving my attentiont to other things that this device. Unsure if it is because of the end of the year or something else, but I see a lot of folks and articles going in that direction.

- That [great article](https://beside.media/how-to-navigate-new-tech-like-the-amish/) on how Amish navigate technology published by Beside. Cal mentions Amishs in his book.
- The [last newsletter](https://www.isaacjohnston.co/blog/why-i-deleted-instagram) from Isaac Johnston. He explains how he uses Instagram and revisits usage. He also mentions Cal Newport's book. You should subscribe to that one!

Ok, it is only two articles but it is already good! I plan to use and try [Freedom](https://freedom.to) to really block a big part of distractions. The easiest to avoid temptation is to block it.

In my slow down move, a lot of the articles I read are from Newsletters and RSS feeds. A bit like 10 years ago... Old is new again. I suggest you to try it. Twitter and Facebook aren't really great sources for quality content, at least not without good filters! I would love your tips and tricks around this actually!

I really loved 2019 even if it was over too quickly. I cannot wait to see what 2020 has for me. I started to state my goals, see what I wanna continue or stop doing. I wish you all the best and I mean it.
