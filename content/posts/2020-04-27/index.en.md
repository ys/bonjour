Ty Lucie has two burning places. One in the living room and a gorgeous wood cooker that also heat the heating system's water in the kitchen. We need logs pretty often for this. We also use wood for the barbecue and fire pit outdoors. We love to use it to chill outside or just cook on it. An essential tool for all of this was a good axe.

A quick tour online and a few questions asked and here I am ordering a [Gr√§nsfors Bruk's axe](https://www.gransforsbruk.com/en/product/gransfors-small-forest-axe/) (If you know how to pronounce it, tell me). This Small Forest axe is a jack of all trades. From carving to small trees chopping, it can do it all. I use it non stop for the last two years.

> "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe."

Used to say Abraham Lincoln. But I ain't as good as he was. Or at least, I wasn't. I realized that my axe was less efficient lately. I owe her way much than this. It was time to learn how to take care of her. I was pleased to see my friends at [Misc. Adventures](https://miscellaneousadventures.co.uk) publish an [IGTV serie of videos](https://www.instagram.com/misc_adventures/channel/) on wood chopping and taking care of your axe and knives. It usually comes as an in person workshop that I still want to attend sooner than later.

My axe had a few hits on the bevel. I had to do a bit more than just re sharpen it. I had to remove those with a file. Andrew from Misc. Adventures was kind enough to directly jump on it and make a short video about this task. I don't think I was the only one in this case but I love to think I was. Same day, the video got published. A DM and he wished me luck. I will tell you how it went.

In the mean time, please go check those videos and tell me what you thought of them on [üê• Twitter](https://twitter.com/bonjouryannick) or [üì∏ Instagram](https://instagram.com/yannickschutz.com)

_P.S.: It went ok. It wasn't super easy but I am happy with the result._
