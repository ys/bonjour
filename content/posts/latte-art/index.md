With [Douarenn](https://en.douarenn.fr), I’ve been fortunate enough to draw the attention of [La Marzocco](https://lamarzocco.com/fr/en/). What came out of this is I got the opportunity to test the [Linea Micra](https://lamarzocco.com/fr/en/home-products/espresso-machines/linea-micra/). Quite a dream for me. The craft they put in to create those. The handwork, the ingenuity, all of this is pure magic. 

When I got the chance to try it. You can be reassured that I made sure it would be in good conditions. Recently, for Douarenn, we started to chat with Antoine from [Café Sable](https://www.sable.cafe/). He recently moved to Crozon and started his own coffee roaster business. He used to be a Barista at l’Alchimiste in Bordeaux before deciding to move here. So, with that in mind, I asked him about teaching me the lost art of steaming milk and latte art. Cause my art was closer to what Pollock would do. 

We decided to meet at Douarenn so he could discover the place where people will soon enjoy his coffees. It was a sunny day and we had really good chats. I ended up learning just enough to become dangerous with the steam wand. Now, it is time to practice.
