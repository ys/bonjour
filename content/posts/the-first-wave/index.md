You wake up, at 40, before dawn and start wondering. You load up the car, it's raining, mid winter. And yet you are excited to get out in that cold morning. You drive an hour and get to the beach. Staring at the waves, you see friends arriving. You share a few words, a coffee and then up up you go. Time to wetsuit up. 

I wasn't meant to be a surfer I guess. Being born east of Belgium and growing there, I was surrounded by fields not waves. It took us more than 3 hours to get to the Belgian coast. And unless you know the subculture there, it isn't kind of beaches known for surf. I was more a skateboarder when I was a teenager. Got the whole culture kit. Listening to punk rock, baggy jeans, holes in the shoes and a board with stickers. I started a bit before Tony Hawk Pro Skater release. Being able to mix skateboarding and video gams got me hooked to the feeling and the culture. 

I had a friend that surfed. I remember thinking he was weird for leaving a good party to drive to the coast early morning. Maybe I should have listened and followed. Nah, I was better having another drink and dance on "Sunday Bloody Sunday". I don't know if it was the same but there wasn't a single party without it. Anyway, this to say that yeah surfing wasn't part of my life until recently.

A few years ago, we moved to Brittany. That move made me want to try. Just trying at first. It sounded fun. I got lessons as a gift for father's day. Five lessons with my son. On the first wave I caught, I was hooked. Skipped the first winter, then I took more lessons. Bought my first foamie. Another winter. This time I surf. Then I bought my first longboard to Hugo selling his 9'6 Mimosa board. And I haven't stopped since. 

I still have a lot to learn. I still am not that good. I guess starting while you are totally not in shape makes it harder. So I started swimming more, Yoga, bodyweight exercises. That part I am still failing at making it an habit. But I keep coming back to it. Because I know it will help my surf. Crazy how this drug is addictive. 

It is not a grateful passion, it is often infuriating. But there I go, I keep coming back to the ocean. I would never have thought I would want to organise my life around a sport. But in the end, it is way more than just a sport. I guess it is my life now.
