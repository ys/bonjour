Less social networks to start the year. As I said, I read Cal Newport’s last book on Digital minimalism and then early yesterday, I read a [blog post](https://thefocuscourse.com/doing-a-digital-declutter/) on the Focus Course on them doing a digital declutter. I was like « Why not » and there it goes, I uninstall Instagram and Twitter from iPad and iPhone. Then install [NextDns](https://nextdns.io) and block all those pesky attention stealers of social networks.

I am starting a 30 days of « No social network ». We will see how it goes. You can still reach me via Email, I would be happy to chat. I was wondering if there was a way to get Twitter/Instagram DMs as emails. If you know a solution, ping me at hello@yannickschutz.com . If you prefer, ask me my postal address and I will happily start a letter exchange with you. That sounds way more personal and mindful than a quick Twitter DM.

NextDNS app is quite amazing for your privacy but also for your digital health. You can block a lot of things. Right now it is in beta and free but I would happily pay for my peace of mind.
You decide what you wanna have access to. You block all the ads trackers. [Freedom](https://freedom.to) is a nice alternative but it goes the opposite direction, you block sites from time to time. NextDns is « you allow from time to time ». And that privacy aspect to it is just the perfect mix for me.

I hope you won’t mind if I share more about other topics. If it can make your life 1% better, I am all for it. I have been a long advocate of minimalism, sustainable consumption and mindfulness. But I kind of lacked a healthier digital life, so here it goes. This all makes me a better, kinder human being. If it can help someone else, I don’t see why I should refrain from sharing. Hope you will like it.

Last but not least, when you start a digital declutter, think about the things that will replace the time not spent on social networks. For me:
