With the new year and thoughts and projects, I decided to dip another toe to the digital camera world. It has been a few years since I really touched a digital camera. I had my ideas about what I wanted but wasn't sure. A friend told me to get them second hand from mpb. Which was an idea I loved. I didn't need the latest generation of anything. I just needed something that took good enough digital pictures. I ain't a medical device. 

So here comes the quest. I decided to first test the Fuji X-pro 3, a camera I knew I wanted for a long time. I decided to test with my Leica lenses. But here comes the disappointment, it was hurting my wrists and my head. No real idea why, like when I got that Contax G2 in my hands. I knew something was wrong. I still can't really explain. It was a physical rejection. So, thanks to their generous policy, I return it. 

I get my hands on a Fuji XH-2, it had a lot of appeal to me. My friend Greg could lend me some lenses, I could even get his aquatech housing if I needed. Lot of good things like those. Once again, mpb order, receiving, testing a few lenses, same dissatisfaction. Sending it back. Back to square one. 

And then I realised I could try a lot but my heart was already set on the sibling from my M6. Could it be that simple? I have that Leica m10-p for a week or so now. I think that was the solution. I needed a slow camera. We shall see how it goes long term, but I do enjoy using something that is closer to the experience I have with film. Sure it has a screen, sure it has a memory card and it isn't film. But lord it is pleasant to use.
